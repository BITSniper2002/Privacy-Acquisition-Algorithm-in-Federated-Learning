[" I like, the sport but there is not MLB team in my city, so I don't watch it. But I find it really interesting, full of small details, like managers wear a uniform so they could replace a player if they need to. ", " I think it is more a hobby than a professional sport, the average salary is around 5500 $ per year, some hobos make more. ", " Panhandling can be quite profitable, for someone with no income. Like in a busy place as Manhattan. But even if I don't consider softball as a legitimate pro sport, if was the first event televised on ESPN.   ", " Can you win money through betting though? That always legitimizes a sport.", " Yes, if it is your criteria, then video game is a legitimate sport. They have leagues and a lot of betting is done on matches. ", " As shooting, and it is even an Olympic sport, but it is strange to see a smoking fat man winning a medal. Do you play video games ?", " Interesting question. I don't think this is any sort of art. It could be kind of sport. I more support this point of view. How about you? What's your opinion?", " Ok. Do you watch or play any sport? Like softball or baseball?", " No I didn't catch their names. But I know that a lot of gold medalist attended as well as some people from the US Olympic softball team, I don't watch sports or the Olympics so I can't say that I know any of the names LOL", " That's great! Not everyone thinks so though, Amazon can come with difficulties in transportation and shoot up the housing costs of whatever city it's in. ", " I would use a rocket launcher LOL just kidding. do you watch soccer at all? Apparently soccer makes more than all other sports combined", " That's a great point! Did you know that table tennis is the name of the actual sport, and that ping pong is only the name of the company that sells the table tennis equipment?", " Not a ton... I love sports though so I could get into it if I needed to. Do you like any other sports?", " Yeah same here, I like to be able to at least play every sport just a bit once. Do you follow tennis at all?", " Yes I think that is the title. Shia LaBeouf stars as McEnroe. I am not really too into sports movies.", " Yes. Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent or doubles.", " Do you like tennis? I just love to play the sport.", " i love it! Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent or in teams", " I didn't know that, she speaks french and italian so I wonder if she owns any sports teams in Europe", " lol  I do remember that.  Both her and her sister brought alot of good publicity to the sport.", " Interesting! Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952. I always associate the olympics with sports!", " I did back in the day.  The 3 best selling videogames of all time are Tetris, Minecraft, and Wii sports.  I had fun chatting with you!", " Hi! Are you a fan of baseball, got any favorite sports teams?", " I think it would. Most men sports leagues don't outright ban females. They usually just have very difficult requirement to meet for females like the nfl", " For some, unless its the attic of a hoarder. I wonder whether other sports team have requirements like baseball managers where they have to wear the uniforms because they have to play if the need arises.", " Hey, you a fan of any sports involving hitting balls with sticks?", " Speaking of famous people who play sports, Samuel L. Jackson actually plays golf twice a week during filming of whatever he's in.", " It probably does, although more important is that softball started as an indoor sport.", " How's it going? Do you like sports?", " Pretty good.  You?  I do like sports.  I'm glad baseball season is about to start back up!", " Man as of 2014 the average salary for a pro softball player was between 5,000 and 6,000, does not sound like a good sport to become a pro in.", " No it really doesn't.  It's odd that's it's so low considering softball was the first sport shown on espn.", " Well i would say soccer is probably the best sport to go pro in because they make more money than basketball,football,and golf combined.", " It's really hard to turn your sport into a major force in the US. With the popularity of the NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL, they dominate the sports scene.", " At least the YMCA created basketball and therefore one of the major sports leagues around today. Not bad for a recreational game they thought up.", " hi how are you? do you like sports?", " I'm doing very well, thanks. I love sports", " I love golf. Its a great sport where individual players hit balls with clubs into a series of holes on a golf course in as few strokes as possible.", " I guess i would want the cheapest stuff. i played sports with minimal equipment growing up.", " I do wear them specially in the winter or when it rains I like to wear sport shoes better but boots can be comfy. ", " Yes, the doping scandal can be hard to come back from. It is amazing the amount of doping in sports today.", " I do!  They wear it because they are technically able to play for their tams if the need arises!  Baseball is a pretty popular sport in Japan.  ", " True. Did you know art and poetry were olympic sports?", " Yes, I love reading. It's kind of funny, because architecture, literature, music, painting and sculptures were olympic events from 1912 until 1952. I don't know why those would be considered sports, but that is quite interesting.", " It is interesting, never considered as sports either, do you know who Winston Churchill was?", " yes.. I think sports are giving knowledge.", " Well, baseball is a really fun sport between two teams, the offensive , who are the batters and the defensive who are in the field.", " Every once in a while. It's one of those sports I would rather play than watch. The Japanese are such big fans of baseball that they would probably take the name \"national pastime\" from the Americans if they could", " I agree with you completely. Those sports are way more physical than baseball. Did you know that the Dodgers have lost more world series championships than any other baseball team?", " I do, it is my favorite sport. Do you watch? ", " It sure doesn't. That's clunky name. Baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans are surprised to discover it's  america's national pastime. I wonder why? The sport started here.", " No I can't say that I do haha. I like I said I don't really watch sports that much. I know that it is the best-of-seven games correct? Who do you want to win this year", " I'm not really into sports, but I learned a lot about baseball.", " Wow, the must really love baseball!  That is a lot of time dedicated to the sport,  that is really sweet that they had something they were both passionate about though. ", " It is odd that managers wear baseball uniforms.  Coaches in other sports don't wear uniforms.", " Yeah it is odd, but do you know why they might wear uniforms unlike other sports?", " That is interesting!  I honestly never knew that!    The womens cup had higher tv ratings than the world series in the US.  That kind of shows the sport is on a downtrend like the cards.", " I never Knew that. But baseball is a slow paced game. I guess the kids like faster paced sports", " The Giants. Unless, you're talking about sports. My favorite sport is basketball.", " United state national sports is base ball. I know it.", " I would practice. I think skills get rusty. Baseball is a team sport, so they should work together. Other teams will have practiced.", " The sports is popular here, but not around the world. The women's world cup had higher television ratings than the world series in the united states.", " Baseball is my favorite sport. Did you know that managers are technically able to play for their teams?", " They do. I have always been a little upset because the US always considers their sports teams as world champs but yet don't have to prove it.", " True, but we Americans have a habit of declaring ourselves world champs in almost all the sports. Just doesn't seem right.", " Naah, me neither ;) I don't care much for that sport - sorry, I'm from Europe, we have different interests I guess... ", " Yeah baseball does have some weird rules. I think its because the sport is so old. My dads favorite team is the cups and they started in 1876! They also had one of the longest droughts ever, 108 years. What is your favorite team?", " Baseball is a fun sport, I like seeing it in person live. Have you ever seen baseball in person?", " That makes sense. Canadians would find the middle-of-the-road term for the sport. What about the man who found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic? That's pretty cool.", " WOw I wonder what happened there. IN Japan the sport is so popular that they don't believe it is just a pastime in the US", " Yeah, it is a good sport. It is also really popular in Japan. ", " Did you ever think about how celebrities in science are rarer than in music, film, sport, and politics?", " Me neither I just like to watch the World Series from time to time, its a sport with a lot of history. ", " I have not, to be honest I'm not a sports fan. ", " I figure that there must be something that can both lift the cubs curse and transport it to the yankees. Who has the most world series thus far?", " I do - it was my favorite sport as a kid.  I even knew the married couple who scheduled all 2000+ games every year", " I bet they due, they really love the sport our there, do you have a favorite baseball team?  I like the Yankees", " It did? Wow, that is suprising, womans sports usually dont get support at all", " yes as little as foreign sports!  During the 92 series the us marines carried the canada flag into the stadium upside down!", " I know that it is a sport, played with a ball called a baseball. There are bases, and players, and bats. And hot dogs and popcorn.", " It is one of the few sports in which the player scores points, not a ball or puck.I wonder how much each baseball costs to make.", " I know a bit, I tend to follow some of the games and I think that it was a good call, baseball is an interesting sport indeed, many cool facts about the game", " Not really.  I find the sport difficult to watch and slow.  What about you?", " Yeah amazing. In Japan the sport seems to be really popular", " Yes, they must really be into it and appreciate the sport", " I guess its not, there are a lot of sports out there, I do like the Yankees and the history the team has", " Yeah, that is pretty funny. Is it a big sport up there? ", " I have never down fantasy sports. I guess the appeal is that you compete and can make some money?", " I'm great! Are you knowledgeable of the sport known as baseball?", " Hi, yes I like baseball , and sports in general....and is true I have never seen a manager playing!! but is good they are ready in case they are needed!", " I would be funny if it was an accident.. You lknow? I really like hoe the world series are played.. It is not just one game..you get a seven game playoff and the excitement lasts more than other sports!", " I understand he is not the only one to come to the US. He did sign that is interesting. Do you follow sports much. I do not which is why I had not known. ", " I do follow sports so that is why I knew.  I am a big fan of english league football actually. ", " I think that soccer is a great sport and while I do not follow, I think it is a lot better than american football is. I would imagine that he is a good player as they did want him badly. ", " Yeah he is a good player and I think he has been doing good for them so far.  And I agree, and I think american football is far more dangerous a sport to play. ", " It certainly is. Soccer is such a popular sport all around the world. I guess a player named Mesut Ozil donated his earnings from a bonus in the World Cup to pay for 23 children in Brazil to have surgeries. What a nice thing to do. ", " I didn't know that. I've wondered though.  We've got all of these sports fans here from different places with competing team loyalties.  Except for soccer. Most of them never had a pro team that they grew up rooting for.  They all grew up knowing something about that.  I mean we're talking 250 million players worldwide. Now these guys have a team to root for with no competing loyalties. It's a more communal experience and it has taken off around here.  ", " I haven't gone yet but I'm going to this coming season.  My interest in other sports has waned so the timing is perfect. Get in on the ground floor of something special you know. It's hard to pick up though. You wouldn't think it would you. A big stretch of grass with a goal on either side's more complex than I thought. Theres way more people to talk about it with too. More than all the major American sports leagues combines in terms of fanbase. ", " Thats a good point about playing FIFA. That was my only exposure to the sport growing up. There's a much lower barrier to entry to play the game in the real world. Probably part of it's popularity. It's kind of funny. The color scheme and the uniforms here kind of remind me of Harry Potter.  I guess ridiculous hats are a thing in football circles. I don't know how else to explain the goofy ones I've seen around here after FC games.  ", " Yup, they seem to do much better. soccer players make more money than other sports combined, well the major ones", " Do you like sports?", " I'm not really into sports, but soccer isn't bad. My friend is obsessed with it and was telling me about this guy Freddy Adu who became pro at 14, I think", " Despite the US not being as supportive of soccer as other sports, the us teams have done amazingly well in the world cups as you mentioned", " Yeah, but i think Americans are getting tired of some of the US only sports. Soccer makes more money than football, basketball, baseball and golf combined.", " I like that some of the players are altruistic at least, even if sports is mostly about money. I heard a German player donated his 300,000 FIFA win money to help kids in Brazil get surgery.", " Yeah, I don't know why they named them the same either. Good chatting with ya and have a great rest of your day watching all sports, like me.", " I too use spotify! I like it better. Did you know that the NFL is legally considered entertainment than a sport like the WWE.", " Absolutely, my husband has had the same sport's coat for years!", " Awesome!  Yeah, I like public transportation when traveling its fun. ", " yes, it is a good way to learn about a country. public transportation is a cheap and convenient way to travel in a foreign land. i recommend it.", " Whoa that's awesome! Did you eat crepes? I want to go to Iceland but it sounds like the public transport isn't great-will probably rent a car.", " Fantasy congress sound like it is taking the whole fantasy sports thing to far.  I can't see many people sitting in bars yelling at CSPAN because their politician has made the wrong move.", " It sure was, I think it should remain an olimpyc event, it may not be a sport but it would be interesting to watch, a prize for the best artist", " Yeah, he's very talented. The father of modern olympics won a gold medal in literature for writing a poem about sports. ", " Wow. It's really amazing what they will do for professional sports. And yet grunting in tennis can be considered cheating. ", " I had no idea. I am in parks and recreation and pickleball is a huge sport for us. At least compared to some other sports. ", " I watch way too much sports. If it is a big moment in sports, I know about it. I wish I watched less tv though but I love sports so much.", " ya you're right, do you know any soccer facts? thats one sport I never watch haha", " Yeah pretty cool. It is a good sport to be in, they make more money than many other sports combined. ", " Oh that is so cool I wanna look that up! Ping pong is like tennis but it isn't the sports name. The sport is actually called table tennis.", " Yes I do it's a fun sport. you? I think it's funny how some people consider grunting before a tennis shot to be cheating.", " Yeah it is such a global sport! On average soccer players run 7 miles per game. No wonder they are in such great shape.", " Yes, it's quite average for 90 min game. I honestly say football, not soccer, because I more interested in this sport and all people in the world call it football. It was slang in US and this is why we call it this way.", " lol That is funny.  I remember hearing that song so much at sports games while I was growing up.  The president of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office. I wonder if they were any good? lol", " Lol. Did you know that an ice hockey rink can be found under basketball courts. They just leave it there when stadium sports change. ", " Yes, I did now that.  Honestly, my wife and I were talking about that last night.  She didn't know that.  Also, baseball may be American's national sport, but Canada is the only country with two, Lacrosse and Ice Hockey.", " kind of, I'm watching the superbowl right now though haha, I guess Canada's national sports are both hockey and lacrosse, I would have thought it was just hockey", " I don't mind hockey. I do know that Canada is the only country in the world with two national sports and they are hockey and lacrosse. ", " Really interesting, do you have any idea of what kind of hockey bandy is?  And did you know Canada is the only country with 2 national sports, hockey being one of them. ", " That would have dried them fast.  Tennis generates good money, but not as much as soccer which makes more than all of the other big popular sports combined.", " I watched it a lot when I was younger. It is the sport that brought us the Polos", " Yes. Tennis is a racket sports played against individuals and Tennis is a olympic sports played at all ages.", " I do, Im really bad at it but I think its a great sport, it can be played among two people which is a great advantage. Do you like the sport?", " That is impressive I think its the first time in the history of the sport, Federer is also the only living person in Switzerland to be honored with an official stamp. ", " That is remarkable.  The sport used to be a lot more influential than it is today.  I recently learned polo shirts were originally invented specifically for tennis!", " I don't really know the sport well. I know that it can earn some people lots of money.", " Yes, while most in American business are wearing dress shirts like suits and ties, Hawaiians can sport the aloha shirt.  How cool that is!", " Yes, hope to make it to Hawaii some day so I can sport the Hawaiian fashion and take in the beauty there.", " Are they physically fit though.  For instant, in a different sport, managers do not have to play.   the notre dame manager before the current one was very fat.  He knew how to manage the team but he could not play football in a million years.  What I'm asking is if the baseball managers need to be able to play baseball effectively.  Is this true that opposing team will receive three bases if a player catches a baseball in their hat?", " I still find it hard to believe that it is the world's most popular sport.", " Yeah. It's the world's game. The money is more than all 4 major sports in the us, combined!", " ya I wonder if they require natural grass? I don't watch sports so I have no idea about the rules of soccer", " So if you don't watch sports, what do you do in your free time. I watch sports, all the time...", " haha well I work and I also play piano and have other hobbies. I don't know. I don't miss sports. I know all my friends watch them, and I'll watch it if we're together, but I don't follow any teams or players or anything.", " I just want to give him an outlet for his anger. He is 7 and likes sports but I want him to have another outlet for stress. Do you play for stress release?", " I like nike and all the sporty type, but also i like polos to look clean, you?", " I'm great! Are you a fan of sports? ", " I am I like pretty much most sports, and I always cheer for all my local teams. ", " Are you into wrestling? It's a sport that I really don't know well.", "  Plato was a professional wrestler before he became a philosopher. Maybe sports excellence and thinking go together. Are you into baskeball?", " Canadian guy named Naismith. Wanted a sport for his players to do in the off-season.", " Morning! Wow, I haven't thought about sports since high school. I didn't realize competitive wrestling really is.", " Apparently its as competitive as other sports, I just to wrestle in high school so it would be nice to remember those times.", " Oh did ya?  I was never very sporty in high school, but I had a friend who wrestled and I remember how he was always so concerned with his weight and trying to make sure he kept in the right weight class. Seemed a very strict kind of sport, like you need to be very diligent to participate.", " I think I would, I just to like it and maybe my kids would too, I would want them to play sports thats for sure, you know Lincoln was a wresler, he is on the hall of hame even", " It's so weird to think of these serious people once being wrestlers. I mean, you have them on the one side, and the other end where folks in Turkey are dousing themselves in oil to wrestle - that oil wrestling sounds more like a spectacle than a serious sport but I guess to each his own, lol.", " It would be interesting indeed, do you like any other sports? Im a basketball fan as well.", " Me either! I'm really not fond of running. Speaking of sports, did you know ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shoes per week?", " That seems pretty scary. I heard talk of them making a really fast mode of transportation like that in America too.", " Wow!  His hands must be intense!!  I don't know a lot about wrestling, but it's pretty funny that the Turkish national sport is oil wrestling!", " I could see that.  I think if he invented the sport it likely wasn't making much money to begin with.  I think it's probably more embarrasing than anything else!  \"The Highest Court in the Land\" is on the top floor of the Supreme Court!  I like their sense of humor!", " Yes!!! Well, basketball isn't the only sport affected by bans of things that helped perfermance, in the world of swimming, there is a swimsuit that was worn 94% of the time in winning swim races... and now that suit has been BANNED!!! ", " Sounds interesting. I watched a little of a viking show (not called viking but cannot remember what it was called) and that was ok. Im just not that into tv anymore, other than live sports.", " yes I agree with that, what I never realized too is taht every president who sported a beard has been a republican haha", " I like to watch sports, drink fine whiskeys and workout. You?", " That's surprising & embarrassing for the women's team. I appreciate the history of the sport. Hockey was in the first Winter Olympic games all the way back in 1924.", " Really? That's how sports are sometimes I guess. Are you much of a country music fan?", " Canada has two national sports, my favorite is lacrosse.", " Very interesting character. I find it funny that his half brother used a fake passport to try getting to Disneyland.", " Yeah that impressive, he was good in more than just one sport", " Do you like hockey? Not really a fan. Don't know much about the game. I do know that Canada is the only country in the world with two national sports, lacrosse and ice hockey.", " I am a Canadian so I like the sport as a default. The snow is pilled up in mountains and the ice rinks are busy. ", " People love to get together and watch games in sports bars and parties. Olympic Hockey is a national moment. ", " Not angry, winter with it;s cold and snow is just apart of our lives for a third of the year. It must have been like playing with children for those Olympic players. Things have changed and more countries have grown to love and respect the sport.", " The sport deserves respect. There are some amazing players. For example, a hockey player was traded for $1 in 1993. He later won four Stanley Cups. How did he win the Stanley Cup by himself? Astounding. He must have been Canadian.", " An ice hockey ring remains under a basketball court when switching stadium sports. What would James Naismith say about that? He was Canadian. Would he give his blessing? ", " Good point.  I'm getting converted to ice hockey.  I've never watched it much but I watched where they let a Navy goalie practice the the St. Louis Blues.  It was fun to watch and has got me a little more into the sport for sure.", " I am a fan, I like the sport, its more popular in Canada though, its actually one of its national sports", " Yes.  I live up North near Lake Erie and before the tv signals went digital I was able to use a tv with an antenna to pick up Hockey night in Canada during the week.  It was like Monday Night football here in the states.  I'm a sports fan so at the time it was great to be able to watch that in the middle of the week.", " Haha. I love hockey. It's the only sport where super dramatic things like that happens. Like in 1930, when a hockey goalie caught on fire because a puck hit a pack of matches in his pocket. Like, why did he have matches in his pockets anyway?", " you know what is weird, that the nfl is classified as an \"entertainment\" business and not a sport, in the legal sense", " That is true, did you know poetry was once an olympic sport?", " Really? Was it a sport to write the poetry or to read it out loud?", " I am not sure, Art and music were also sports as well", " Ha! Yeah I'm fed up with real politics, I don't need more in my life lol That would make it more fun to get background checks though haha do you play fantasy sports? ", " I love that show! Do you play or watch any sports? I just read about cricket- nothing I'm familiar with, but I did see that the longest match in history took 14 days. I wonder how long a normal match takes...", " I dont play any sports,  I work out,  go to the gym,  snowboard and swim.  I have never played cricket,  but that is insane!  I have heard of tennis matches going for like 3 days though lol ", " I do not. I cannot understand it for the life of me. I do love sport though.", " That's a strange name for sure haha, I wonder if he ever got bullied for it in the sport. I know the best player in cricket's history had nasty tactics against him, leading to the other teams facing consequences", " that is interesting. that is not what i thought at all. i thought it was a sport since the outcome is not known before hand.", " I am not familiar with Gladstone, but recently learned his story of using his wheelbarrow to transport 32,000 books at age 85.  I would love to be in that kind of shape at 85!", " I read some of them when I was younger.  Now I mainly read autobiographies, history, business, investiong, and sports books.  lol  Almost all of his books are connected.", " It's fascinating how specialized our footwear is to be tailored to different sports.  Like cleats!  Who would have thought?", " I've been wanting to watch it. Soccer makes more money than most sports combined worldwide.", " That is also surprising to hear, but when you think about it so many countries participate and it's a global sport.  I also didn't know that there was a variation that involved 3 teams at a time-were you aware of that?", " Yeah, it is a great opportunity for refugee kids to learn a great sport!", " It is right, like Quriesh Ahmad, he liked soccer, sports can really save the lives  of people", " Soccer truly is a world wide sport.  There is a German soccer player who donated his world cup victory bonus to  pay for surgery for 23 Brazilian kids.", " I do.  It is one of my favorite sports.", " It is so popular it makes more than most other sports combined!", " I like the sport a lot. I just can't believe that there are only five players at a time on each side. It always seems like more.", " That's interesting. I wonder why. It's not the only strange Olympic sport. During those same years architecture, music, painting, and sculpture were also Olympic events. ", " Hockey and lacrosse are the official sports of Canada. There should be NBA teams in other big cities in Canada though.", " Stan lee is excellent writer also, he make the movie interesting. Which is your favourite sports ?", " Nice. How I met your mother was underrated. I really like westworld but I can get confused watching it. I watch a lot of live sports too.", " I like baseball and all sports in general. And you know what, I used to play kickball as a kid!!", " Really! Its not depressing to me. I love poetry!  Very interesting Art, music and poetry were once olympic sports! ", " I did hear that.  Interesting. I wonder if baseball rules are the same in Japan, where it's an incredibly popular sport? ", " Hello there, I don't follow too much but think it is a very exciting sport.  How about you?", " That is very impressive, I think if you are still playing pro sports past your 20's you are doing pretty good. ", " Right, I know. Del Port said that its not the best way to win a match and that would have loved to play against Rafa because hes the biggest fighter in the sport.", " Yep! The nfl is recognized as an entertainment business rather than a sport, legally, like the wwe", " I didn't know that. I know that wrestling isn't a sport because you can't gamble on the outcome, which is known beforehand.", " ya he must be relaxed, it's weird that Canada's national sports are hockey and lacrosse, I would imagine hockey is but I wouldn't have predicted that lacrosse is their other sport, I'd say that is not too popular in the USA", " I agree, I thought in the US lacrosse was more a rich family/Ivy League elite sport. Canada always struck me more middle/working class so it was surprising to me lacrosse was a national sport.", " Did you know that Canada has another national sport besides hockey?", " I was unaware there were any sports in Canada besides hockey!", " Haha, that is funny. Lacrosse is also a national sport in Canada.", " Apparently hockey is a good sport to take up for weight loss. A hockey player can lose up to 8 pounds in a game.", " ice form, Lacrosse and ice hockey are both Canada's national sports ", " Two national sports.  That seems a little greedy.  I've never been much of a skater, a few times when I was a kid, but never got into it.", " They are the only country in the world that has two national sports ", " I wonder if you can feel the temperature of the ice through the temporary court?  It's time we came up with a new sport, ice basketball, the same basketball just on ice.  Then they would not have to keep switching the court from one to the other.", " Me too!  Speaking of being hit, did you know that the NFL is not a sport but an entertainment industry?", " Yes, McEnroe was a terrible sportsman, but a great player. Serena has certainly achieved success.", " Can't really say that I do. DOn't know the sport well. You?", " I have no idea. Is that originally a tennis shirt? Seems pretty stylish for sportswear.", " Tennis is the sport of the wealthy and there is an imbalance in wealth. The sport will change. The Williams sisters have done well.", " Something pretty basic like public transportation. I think it's not rocket science and would help the average Joe.", " I'm not musical, but I would love to hear both. I find it interesting that music, art and poetry were once olympic sports.", " True. The league wasn't formed until the 1940s, which is fairly recent compared to other popular sports", " If you take the average per playter, basketball players are actually the best paid athletes in the world. I guess that shows how much of a team sport it is", " No, I don't usually watch television at all, let alone sports. Of the four major sports leagues in the US, the NBA isn't one I keep up on much", " No, I have never known how to play, seems like a boring sport to me but I know many people are sick fans.", " Not really, I find the sport boring, do you like it?", " I took golfing in college twice and it was not that boring to actually play golf. It is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible. I actually like playing 18 holes better than miniature golf.", " Gold is a really popular sport theres even a golf course in Antarctica", " I didnt know that, talented athlete not only skilled in baseball but also a great golfer, he had a knack for sports I guess", " HA, that would be a funny guy to know and listen to tell stories! I have been thinking September means golf, golf courses and sports clubs. I want a fitness routine that prevents me from overdoing it. ", " Really, thats kind of crazy.  I heard the NFL is categorized as entertainment, not sports", " Yes - did you ever play video hockey games?  They are fun but not as fun as the real sporty", " Canada is the only country with 2 national sports - both lacrosse and ice hockey", " The game has changed a lot since 1924, the first Olympic Winter games, Canada has two national sports", " ya I like the Penguins a lot, I guess it is canada's national sport, that along with lacrosse", " I like movies, music, etc. I do like to watch Hockey. It's a fun sport to watch.", " I do like to watch hockey, its a fun but violent sport", " True. Canada is the only country in the world with 2 national sports..ice hockey and lacrosse.", " The only one really? I know they liked hocky a lot but didnt know lacrosse was their other national  sport", " I guess.  Why horses are a mode of transportation, they are typically not considered a \"vehicle\".  But, not long ago, it was not uncommon to read about a small town drunk who lost his driver's licenses and then rode their horse drunk and got arrested again for \"operating under the influence\".  Horses today tend to be more a hobby with fewer and fewer working horses.  I still like riding my horse though many others have switched to ATVs.  ", " No, I did not know that, although I am a fan of softball, do you play any of those sports?", " I know, that is really impressive! and another interesting fact is that the first sporting event to be broadcasted on ESPN was actually a softball game", " Really, that surprises me. I am shocked that the first sporting  event shown on ESPN was a slow pitch softball game", " No doubt.  I wonder if that was when he was on steroids? lol  The first sporting event ever shown on ESPN was a slow pitch softball game between the Kentucky Bourbons and the Milwaukee Schlitz.  Ha!  Perfect beer league names!", " Yeah that used to be my go to sport when I was a kid.  I used to tape all of the dunk contests.  I used to love Larry Johnson and Shawn Kemp.

Also, it's consistently among to top public recreational activities.", " They probably would rather play hockey in Canada since hockey is one of the two national sports there with the other being Lacrosse.", " That was definitely a steal for whatever team got him! I guess it happens in every sport", " Probably so true. Did you know that an ice hockey ring remains under a basketball court when switching stadium sports? I didn't realize that one.", " It makes sense though to utilize the space for more than one sport. Both are popular in other countries", " No wonder it's a national sport. I've never heard of bandy, but apparently it's a type of hockey", " Yes, that is true, hockey is a sport in which two teams play against each other by trying to manoeurvre a ball or a puck into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick.", " Basketball is a great sport do you follow it?", " combined?! Is that only for swimming only or for all sports combined?", " Its a tough sport to play indeed, back in 1993 a player was traded for only $1, that player then won 4 Stanley Cups", " Same here. Did you know it's considered an entertainment business rather than a sport?", " Apparently Canada is the only country with 2 national sports. I wonder how they define what a national sport is.", " okey.Swimming is consistently among the top public recreational activities,[2][3][4][5] and in some countries, swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the educational curriculum.[6] As a formalized sport, swimming features in a range of local, national, and international competitions, including every modern Summer Olympics.", " It is interesting that babies can even perform movements like swimming with in weeks of birth. It is a very innate and natural sport.", " That's cool. I'm originally from NY so that explains my preference for the Islanders. Canada is so good at hockey because it is their national sport. They're the only country with 2 national sports,", " I think you're right there national sports are lacrosse and ice hockey. I guess Hockey is referred in other countries as field hockey. Only in about five countries total is it referred to as just hockey", " I do know how to swim.  Do you know much about the sport and do you swim?", " That's incredible. I wonder who dominates Olympic hockey. I'd guess Canada, since they did so well in the first winter Olympics and it's their national sport.", " I think ice would be the most fun, but it would also be hard to learn to skate AND play the sport at the same time!", " Good morning! How are you? I am a sports fan, what about you?", " I like all sports to watch. To participate it would be swimming, but just for fun. No way I could compete in a dolphin like swimming style with my arms and legs bound.", " Good for them. I think they were smart beyond their years. Swimming is a top recreational sport, so it seems its popularity has been around a long time.", " Yep. Anywhere there is water people swim. With our competitive nature we are bound to turn it into sport.", " The cheerleaders. I would be a hockey fan if there were cheerleaders for that sport. But they would distract the players from the puck.", " Hockey is the national sport of canada. Although so is lacrosse. How did they get two?", " I think that is very surprising, but yes I did in fact know that. Hockey is a big sport in Canada, which makes sense why they scored 132 goals in 1924.", " That is huge, and it is also one of the national sports there", " It is surprising how Canada only has two national sports, lacrosse and ice hockey. Other countries usually have more. ", " Hi. Do you enjoy watching or playing sports? I'm not very athletic, but I love to watch.", " Yes, basketball is one of the sports I really like.", " Not really. I know you use a hockey stick. ;) We had to spend some time playing field hockey in school, and I scored a goal. I hear it's a great sport in which to lose weight. Pro's lose weight from the activity in even one game.", " Don't know, but I hear that is true. I think Canada played in the first winter Olympics. It is one of their national sports along with lacrosse, which I know nothing about,", " I like watching hockey on TV, but I wonder about all the hitting they take, it's a rough sport.", " Hee.  I wonder what Canada's high court has.  They have two national sports: lacrosse and ice hockey.  ", " It's possible that he was coaching a different sport and invented basketball as a way to redeem himself", " Wow that is pretty crazy haha. I bet the team that traded him is kicking themselves haha. Why do you think Canada's national sports are lacrosse and ice hockey?", " I know right? Why not change the rules to suit you. Haha, just kidding. I went to a Suns game, in Phoenix. I don't really follow sports though.", " If he keeps on losing, he needs to step it up and have a conference about the rules. The Suns against the Warriors? It is okay. I follow sports when my family and friends are watching them.", " Do you like Hockey? Canada actually has another national sport besides hockey. It is lacrosse.", " Interesting. I wonder if it will ever be one of our national sports.", " Yeah, there are probably tons of things that will evolve in the sports arena. The British didn't even know how to front crawl before it was introduced by the Native Americans.", " Indeed. Canada is the only country in the world with two national sports: Hockey and lacrosse.", " The Ice Hockey ring remains under a basketball court when switching between sports. Amazing right>", " Swimming is a very interesting sport. It's awesome that Sean Conway Jr. got so many all-American times in 2018. What about you?", " Swimming is a great sport. Not only do you get great exercise, but because you are in water, the stress on your body is lowered", " Probably both if it is affordable. Is there any other sports you enjoy?", " Yes, I really enjoy ice hockey. It's the national sport of Canada, along with lacrosse.", " No wonder hockey is their national sport.", " Are you a fan of sports?", " I think the endorsements for an Olympic gold medalist is a big incentive to win.  Do you know Canada is the only country in the world with two national sports?", " Must be!  National sport.  Did you know professional hockey players lose up to 8 pounds per game?  Wonder about basketball and swimming, how they measure up to that?", " I thought swimming is the sport to loose weight the quickest ?", " That is very true, I think it requires just as much skill and training as any professional sport. ", " Somewhat.  It was an Olympic event from 1912-1952.  I don't know how you turn that into a sport?  lol", " I really have trouble wrapping my head around that. Especially considering some of the stuff that's rejected as an olympic sport.", " How interesting. I would not even know how to begin my team. I know of fantasy sport teams but not spelling bee. I learned there is even a fantasy congress!", " Not so much recently, but I have been to other places, and it's always interesting to see how they go about transportation differently than in the U.S. Iceland doesn't even have public rail service!", " I can't even imagine using airplanes as a substantial mode of transportation! I prefer places like Mackinac Island where there are no vehicles at all.", " that is good. it is a sport after all. it represents sportsmanship to young people.", " Yeah, dedication is also an admirable trait within baseball or any professional sport.  Like the married couple who for 24 years scheduled every single baseball game played during those years.", " Lacrosse is also an intense physical sport, I can see its appeal to Canadians!", " Nice, is it your favorite sport? ", " Well Canada is the only country in the world with two national sports Lacrosse and Ice Hockey.", " Not worth much, but what a good trade.  Can you guess what is under a basketball court in a sport stadium?", " the japanese really do like the sport. the high school is really a big thing there. a televised tournament twice a year.", " Yeah, there is baseball in canada, but the national sports are hockey and lacrosse. soccer-baseball? Huh?", " Ha!  An ice hockey ring remains under a basketball court when switching stadium sports.  That has to be a pain in the butt changing the floor.", " That would have been funny to see.  Canada is the only country in the world with 2 national sports hockey and lacrosse. lol", " Do you enjoy sports?", " It depends on the sport, I used to be a gymnast, and think it's cool that the ancient Greeks practiced it for war.", " I feel that despite its image, it is a very difficult sport", " Despite it's image? it's not know for being a lazy sport. Even the pommel horse was originally developed for soldiers.", " I mean I understand it is an intense sport that requires endurance, strength, coordination, and flexibility to say the least, but it isn't one of the sports that come to mind as being dangerous or I guess tough like rugby or football", " It's a cover for the ice rink. Like a sub floor. They are common with stadiums that don't have a lot of room, and both sports are played.", " I'm glad they observed a moment of silence. It's important to recognize that life is more than sports.", " True, but sports help too, and it is good the Stanley Cup game continued as planned.", " The fans needed the distraction and sports do bring people together. It's too bad that a tragedy has to happen for us to see a need to change security measures, but we can't always anticipate tragedy.", " Well, what would you expect when it is a national sport!     Canada has another sport at that level, don't they?", " Yeah. Their other national sport is lacrosse. ", " Interesting.   I've always found multiple sports venues fascinating.", " heard assange was offered an australian passport, I always thought he was european", " I'm good. Do you follow any sports at all?", " I sometimes follow sports. I enjoyed watching basketball and soccer. What about you?", " The whole sport is about shoes. Anything to get people to buy shoes. Is tennis the same way?", " I guess. I don't know the sport. Shirts, rackets, headbands, helicopters? They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 us open", " They must have sponsorships. I see them in commercials. The sport is closely related to croquet", " Yeah I agree. And everyone has an opinion they're just dying to express.  I feel like this happens more in football than in other sports, like baseball and tennis. ", " The would have been wild. They should reinstate that rule. I'd like do see someone come in with a loaf of hero bread. That would be entertaining to watch. Everyone has gotten so serious and is always offended these days. We always looked to sports as a form of entertainment but now it's so political.", " Are you a fan of any sports?", " I like all sports. When I get bored, I usually watch sports. It's what I do. What about you? Do you like sports?", " Not really, if it's not in movie format I have a hard time following sports. But I do know that it's super popular in Japan isn't it?", " Oh man I've never heard that! I guess that makes sense in a way because they are indoor sports locations but that is interesting. Volleyball is shocking though that seems like it would have been invented at a beach, right?", " Whoa!  1844 I just looked it up.  lol  The first sporting event shown on ESP was a slow pitch softball game!", " That's interesting, I wonder why they picked that to be the first sport on ESPN, was is hugely popular at that time? Or maybe just cheap to get since they don't seem to pay their athletes that much", " boy, those canadians. I wonder what other  words they have for sports. ", " Hello, are you particularly interested in sports?", " Sure. I enjoy many different sporting events, including baseball and football. I even ejoy celebrity sporting events. You?", " Ahh ok that makes sense, there's a lot of history between them. Although the YMCA invented softball and other sports, but I don't think they did baseball.", " Interesting. Did you know that the first ESPN televised sporting event was a softball game?", " Yeah they really should have changed the name of the sport since now the ball is similar to a normal baseball.", " Yeah it's certainly interesting! Then again I'd argue it really is more popular here, people are so dedicated to the sport. Like until 2005, a single married couple scheduled all MLB games over 24 years, that's nuts!", " Yeah that's true, I guess sports are called differently all around the world. I wonder if there are secret places only baseball players know about, like Pixar has a secret room celebrities often visit.", " I wonder if it is more of a girl sport?", " That is true. The first sporting event shown on ESPN was a slow-pitch softball game between the Kentucky bourbons and the Milwaukee schlitz. Classic! Anyway, great chat!", " I keep trying to get my son to do that coding, he just wants to play the games instead.  Who knows, maybe one day he'll prove me wrong and make it big in e-sports.", " I sort of agree with you there but there are ways to overcome that like boy/girl scouts; 4 H or sports", " Yeah I head about that a while ago. You'd think the person who invented the sport would be good at coaching it, with his advantage in knowing the rules, but I guess not.", " Yeah,  I never wouldve guessed.   Did you hear that in 39 of 50 states the highest paid person is the college or basketball coach,  this sport generates a lot of money!", " I enjoy watching movies or sports", " Hi there! How are you tonight? I am a big sports fan. Are you?", " I am well, hoping you are too.  Yes I love sports!  ", " Probably not,  I dont really keep up with sports much.  Thats sounds like a fun show though.  Do all the teams participate in it? Wow this is weird : The new zealand basketball team are nicknamed the \"tall blacks\"", " I'm not sure if all teams participate in the all star game. It's not like tennis, which is an individual or doubles sport. ", " Priorities right? It's one of the only sports with no standard course/court for the sport. I like how it can switch up like that.", " I never knew that, that is really crazy. Lowest score wins, I could definitely use that in the other sports I play haha.", " It is confusing having different names for the same sport. It makes sense that it would be called football though.", " I think it is confusing too. Soccer makes more money than most sports combined.", " Yep. Soccer makes more money than most sports combined world wide.", " Yeah, it is the world's most popular sport. Wonder why it's not so popular in the US", " Yeah that is him. Do you know who invented the sport?", " Well, that's ok. Do you follow any other sports? NBA is only one of four major professional sports leagues in the US. ", " Those are all great choices. Watch any sports?", " I am not a big fan of sports mostly because they feel like a social media personality contest than a great competition. Even the Olympics have become a reality show.", " We know what the star players make, but the journeyman and 2nd string players make a lot less.   Considering the short duration of a sports career, having a fallback plan, i.e. a degree, makes sense.    Stephen Curry played for Davidson College, and very small school in NC.  I wonder how the scouts were able to seek him out?  I had never heard of Davidson College till recently.", " Yes.  I agree.  I love how listening to music can immediately transport you back to a chapter in your life.", " I'm sure every country would love to claim that they have gold medalist writers, composers, and artists. I really enjoy the Olympics for some of the sports I am usually never exposed to, do you watch them?", " Yeah, it is hard to find camaraderie in professional sports. it is worth holding on to.", " It is a great sport", " Do you enjoy watching sports?", " I do very much, I have a DVR and it is mostly sports programs, how about you?", " It is a popular sport with 30 games, 29 of them from the US and the other is a Canadian team", " Yeah I think its the Raptors, the NBA is one of the four mayor sports leagues in the US and also Canada", " I think that applies to most guys in sports. Steph also participates in a foundation that will donate three mosquito nets for each three pointer he makes", " Yeah that seems to be a common theme with sports players.  I wonder how if the fact they think things like \"you have to be your biggest fan\" contributes to that?", " Im not much into sports.", " That's a great idea. I think baseball has some kind of retirement plan, but I don't know about other sports. I feel sorry for the players because I think people take advantage of them.", " Do you enjoy sports?", " I do. My favorite sport is Basketball. What about you?", " Do you like watching sports?", " I do way too much lol. I didn't know that Amazon is trying to get into sports broadcasting, I guess they are into everything else ", " I was even surprised to learn that Disney is into sports broadcasting...I always associate Disney with movies but they are so much more.", " Exactly. There's always more and more money involved in getting what we are used to having. They have said that some sports content would be only with prime...but others would stream free. ", " Really? That's pretty cool. They definitely seem to have it all figured out and growing and growing, I don't pay for Prime but I guess if I want to watch sports in the future or watch a baseball game I will have to join lol...I heard also that IMBD is owned by Amazon...didn't know that!", " Same here.  Having live sports is an advantage I want them to keep.  After all, a company who takes the time to dub the Lion King in Zulu is my type", " Me too! I guess that is a far off hope but ya never know. I think a lot of people would be upset if Amazon took over sports and you had to pay to watch Baseball games.", " Did you hear that Amazon is trying to get into sports broadcasting", " Sports does not seem to be the focus of Disney's brand. Amazon has moved into entertainment, but I wonder how they will establish themselves in sports.", " Lots of sports out there to cover. Is Amazon thinking of doing baseball? ", " did you know soccer is the worlds most popular sport?", " Yes Absolutely Soccer is the worlds most powerful and very popular sport.", " Yeah I agree not sure what the deal with that is. Football/soccer is a great sport though. It makes the most money out of any sport!", " Yes I think it makes more money then every other sport combined! Even American football, which makes a ton of money here", " Oh I see, interesting. I like that soccer is a global sport but I wish the global population cared more for the environment. Almost 80% of the forests are destroyed on this earth.", " Yeah the US women's team has been the best since the sport started basically.  And France won it this year for the men's. ", " I watch the premier league because it is on before college football and the NFL. Do you like any other sports?", " I have heard that there are other sports than soccer, but soccer makes more money than football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and hockey combined. I follow the money. The money is with soccer", " There should be more altruism in sports though. Consider German soccer player Mesut Ozil, who donated his world cup victory bonus to pay for surgeries for 23 children in Brazil. Maybe one of those kids would grow up to defeat him in the WC. Maybe they would donate their bonus to him.", " That's the circle of professional sports life. I find those stories so heart-warming. We hear too often of the bad things athletes do but never the good things. Good for Masut!", " Yeah they sure are, aren't they the only country to have two national sports?", " Yes it is, there is another island in North Carolina that doesn't allow cars and stuff, the only transportation there is golf carts and walking.", " What's your favorite sport?  How do you feel about ice hockey?", " Ice hockey is a fine sport.  Give people a hockey stick and let them fight for money.  Might add a goal and a puck to make it interesting.", " Yea damn that's a tragedy.  I can't imagine... seems like it brought a lot of people together in the grieving process.  If it's one of the national sports in Canada, I'm sure it touched many people.  I had no idea the other national sport is lacrosse, though.  ", " I don't know... you basically covered them all, unless maybe hot air balloon travel.  I don't think that's too practical though.  I kind of wish the U.S. had a better public transportation in general... maybe we could follow the dutch and build some sweet buses that can go 160 mph.", " I dont keep up with the sport at all,  but I have watched a few games.  Soccer makes more money than most of our popular us sports put together!  crazy", " It's really a genius idea! sad because I like tennis a lot, but soccer actually makes more than all other sports combined, even tennis", " I agree!! Yet soccer makes more money than all other main sports combined, how is that possible?", " I agree with you! I can't believe that it is that popular. But it is a worldwide sport. I should start playing soccer, the average soccer player runs 7 miles per game", " hi how are you? do you like sports?", " Hello, I love sports. What about you?", " Me too. Soccer makes more money than most sports combined. ", " I dont really follow the sport. I have only played a couple of times.", " Sounds like it would fun to see one live. It just bothers me sometimes that the US declares themselves the world champions in a lot of different sports and don't have to proof it.", " Have you ever played any sports?", " The sports production industry must be making a lot of money from all the balls and equipment they have to make, plus fan products like baseball cards too. A man once found 3 million dollars worth of cards in his grandfather's attic!", " Wow. It's funny most people think about baseball and football being the most major sports, when soccer actually makes more money than all of the major sports combined.", " Well, soccer is an international sport. Baseball and football are mostly localized to specific areas, but soccer is played in over 200 countries.", " The Super Bowl might be part of America's most popular sport, but soccer is the world's most popular sport.", " I dont usually watch other soccer. i know that it is a worldwide sport that people love.", " I don't know all difference, but it looks like soccer actually. I like it. In fact, it's my favorite sport. Do you like soccer?", " Agreed. Generally, what's your favorite sport?", " I can imagine. It's trully sport number 1 in the world.  However, US events like Superbowl make a lot of money", " I like tennis. I used to watch a lot when I was a child. I even played recently and it's not easy sport. You need to make a lot of effort. ", " Playing indoor soccer, running hard one way, then turning and trying to plant another way, sucked a lot.  But, I didn't do it while not playing a sport like old Rog there. ", " yea at least you have an excuse! that sounds rough, thats my biggest fear when im playing sports", " Most celebrities are people, like actors or athletes.  I wonder who the highest paid sports figure is?", " I actually was doing a radio show at the time not far from where LeBron was from in Akron so I was able to get the hook up from other radio friends on the sports side of things.  I got to see Jordan play at the old Richfield Coliseum where the Cavs used to play before they moved to downtown Cleveland.", " Yeah I agree. His heavy lift rocket that will help him do so is called the mars colonial transporter. Nice chatting with you mate.", " really, and I adore sports cars, M6 pack is my everything. And did you know that The toyota group owns 10% of tesla, and tesla actually helped to develop their 2nd gen rav4ev?", " wow that would be awsome and my dream will come true of flying to Mars lol. Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and lead designer. He helped fund Tesla, Inc., an electric vehicle and solar panel manufacturer, in 2003, and became its CEO and product architect... he is step by step achieving all his goals", " I used to be years ago when I was young. It's a nice team sport with much skill involved.", " You know the sport is also popular in Japan, ", " It would be interesting to find out, so do you like sports maybe basketball?", " I like sports.  I've been watching a little college basketball lately.  Speaking of, did you know that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar used the dunk shot so much that it got banned from college basketball for years?", " Yeah. Many states see it as a ROI issue. If their revenue sports can cover their lower tier sports, they do not need to subsidize them as much.", " I wonder why 5000 year old shoes perform better and if that would still hold true while playing sports?", " I do, I love basketball think its a great sport and LeBron is the best, his a genius player", " I dont know all the rules either,  but for the most part I like the sport.  ", " Yes, he play for the New England Patriots, did you know Canada is the only country in the world with two sports lacrosse and ice hockey.", " Wow. Did you know Canada has two national sports?", " Did you know Canada is the only country in the world with 2 national sports?  lacrosse and Hockey", " hi I do like sports, music, and since I was a kid I loves playing Nintendo!, what about you?", " Haha. She was a good sport. After hearing eminem's verse on drake's song forever, kanye west took two days and cancelled appointments to rewrite his.", " Can you Imagine traveling a bus or any on ground transportation traveling at a speed of 160 mph?", " Baseball is my favorite sport out of the big four - AZ Diamondbacks are my team", " Baseball is a sport that seems to be dwindling in popularity, unfortunately.", " Popularity is difficult to gauge in regional areas where there are no allegiances - Fantasy sports may be keeping baseball alive ", " I wonder if they have baseball cards in Japan too? It is also a very popular sport there.", " So why did kickball never catch on as an adult professional sport? In Canada they call it soccer baseball. Makes sense.", " I am a sports fan in general. I did attend some baseball games in the past. I do like it.", " Not at all. I'm not much of a sports fan of any kind. Are you?", " That makes sense. I tend to do laundry in my room while watching tv. I usually end up watching sports though. I miss too much in movies and tv to follow along.", " I would like to meet some Japanese who watch American baseball, because I hear they're big fans of the sport. Have a good evening!", " No. But I would pay a bit for that experience.  I have also been to a Garth Brooks in a sports arena which is another place where concerts occur.", " I wonder if Babe Ruth ever made an appearance in the Canadian league? It's a popular sport up there too.", " I am! What about you? I actually wish art, poetry and music were still Olympic sports like they used to be!", " I hear you. When the stakes are high. Interesting sport though. Baseball managers wear uniforms because they can play for their teams should the need arise. I think this must be a holdover from an earlier era when a player was chosen to manage. ", " Probably true.  Baseball has a long history, even with just the world series starting in 1903, more years than most sports in the US", " Those would be treasures for sure.  It would definitely be a big part of the sport's history, maybe making it into a museum some day.", " Not at all, I like keeping politics and sports separate.  Im just there for the entertainment.", " Yes.  It would be kind of neat having a leg like that!  She will even be able to play sports and dance!", " Yes at least Japan has a great public transportation system.", " Lol, it may have been. I didn't know Judge Judy made that much! I wonder if the inventors of the sport, basketball, patented it, imagine all the royalties or license fees that would be coming in", " Good question. Probably due to the massive global interest in the game, while some of those other sports are only regional in interest. How did hockey get on that list? THere is no ball in hockey!  Oh, well, I'll let it slide. After all, Polo shirts were first designed for tennis players. Now tennis players wear clothes designed by Serena Williams.", " They have to be! I was not a grunter when I played tennis in HS either, but I did enjoy the popping sounds when the ball struck the racket at the sweet spot. It does sound like an epic match. Do you still play any of those sports you once played?", " Hi, how are you? Do you like sports?", " Hello - I love sports. What about you?", " I sometimes follow the sports. The championships are exciting. I have watched the basketball.", " Yeah. Do you know who invented the sport?", " Sure, who doesn't like entertainment?  I especially like the NFL which is considered entertainment rather than sport by legal definition.", " I never really appreciate ballet as an artform. It always seemed athletic to me, like sports. ", " At least the player with the bat is usually pretty far away from the other team's players. Maybe it's a healthy way to build teamwork and camaraderie by playing sports. Hey, it's probably friendlier than a congressional debate!", " I would love to have a transformer as a pet. You could sport any car you wanted and have protection.", " It's hard to imagine dunking wasn't part of the game at any time. And the inventor of basketball, James Naismith, was a coach. But funny enough, he was actually the only coach in the history of univ. of kansas that was losing.....and he actually invented the sport!", " I can understand. I do like basketball and enjoy the playoffs.  Is there a sport that you do like?", " They put a ban on it for some reason. I think they thought it was unfair or unsportsman like. ", " I know.  I think sports were more popular back then which allowed for more leagues because it seems like the histories of the other sports are that way too.", " That's nice. I appreciate when famous people go out of their way to be kind. Do you like professional sports? I don't pay much attention but my husband enjoys the NBA.", " I do.  I'm a huge sports fan.  Speaking of kind players Tim Duncan was always a nice NBA player.  He had good character.  He sacrificied money and stayed in college for 4 years instead of going directly to the NBA.  If my memory is right, I believe he did that to honor the wishes of his grandmother who he always promised he would go to college and graduate.", " Guitar is a good instrument. I play piano personally and I like that a lot. Do you ever watch any sports though?", " Nice, The piano is beautiful too and so romantic! I do occasionally watch sports. I watch some basketball although not too often, how about you?", " Her first film role was a sports movie", " Good question. They both have held up pretty good. Meryl's first film role was in a sports movie. I wonder what her last movie will be about.", " neither can I. i hope that we get more public transport to reduce the traffic, but we need cars! anyway, great chat!", " That is very cool, that sounds a bit like what Johnny Depp does, he sports his full Jack Sparrow costume for visits to sick kids in hospitals.

I heard they make more money than most sports combined worldwide. ", " Yeah, it is their favorite sport", " Wow that is funny, I wonder if that has ever happened.

It's hard to believe the NBA has only been around since 1946. It's a fairly new sport, I guess.", " No, I don't really watch golf or participate in the sport.  I do think the courses are beautiful though.", " That is true, it's not something that I realized.  I think that it's still a good thing to have as both a sport and a form of exercise.", " Probably because its a desert I assume and they go through so much. It's interesting how its one of the few sports that doesn't have a standardized play area.", " Good morning... Just catching up on sports...

Speaking of sports, do you follow hockey much?", " Its a violent sport that is a sure thing, players can lose up to 8 pounds in a game! it sounds like its not only metally demanding but really takes a toll on players", " Eight pounds in one game?

All sports are exciting when you go to the events with the atmosphere!!", " I agree.  It's weird that they have facial recognition in the photos now as well.  I notice that sometimes.

Do you watch sports for entertainment too?", " Is MMA considered a sport? Oooh is martial arts considered entertainment? Yeah. I think boxing counts too. I really like Mixed Martial Arts. And I've had a few friends that played soccer, but that's about it. Oh my dad loved football when I was growing up and I'd watch although I had no idea what was going on. Haha!", " Right, I think Americans are the only ones who call it that. I wonder why Americans don't like soccer as much as other sports. It's the world's most popular sport.", " Right, it feels like in the US that more people play soccer as kids than watch the professional sport. ", " I like video games and sports. How about you?", " Football (soccer)is the most popular sport in the world played in more than 200 countries. I was in Thailand and they have no idea what american football is, haha", " It's amazing how far-reaching the sport is. I don't think there's a single other sport that has an international audience in the same way.", " No worries. Sometimes sports is so exciting and full of energy that the details slip my mind too!", " Haha, long time ago! I think it's because the best athletes in the U.S. tend to play other sports than soccer. It's not where the money is here.", " Still precious though. IN Japan it seems to be a really popular sport, they are avid fans of it", " True.  Kickball was a fun sport to play as a kid.  Do you follow any particular baseball teams?", " Yes, sorry. I get so excited about the sport I lose track!", " I understand, it is a fun sport.  It has been fun talking baseball with you.  Hope you have a good rest of your day!", " Yeah. It is a sport that makes more than some other combined", " Basketball is my favorite sport to play.  When I watch the games I can relate to the athletes on a personal level because it is my favorite sport.", " Baseball is my favorite sport. And my favorite coach, Billy Mays, had a memorable funeral.

I'm not sure about their sports like football or anything, though. I've never been into any association football. Do you like it?", " Wow, I didn't realize that! If I had to do a sport I'd pick something equestrian, I think. I wish our government had better programs so our citizens could be more well rounded.", " I don't watch very often. I try to watch the World Cup. I'm not surprised that soccer generates more revenue than many other sports combined.

Soccer makes more money than other sports. It was played in over 200 countries.", " I have recently become a soccer fan.  I never liked it growing up, but I have gained a new appreciation for it.  Do you follow the sport at all?", " No, not really.

It was a popular with kids when I and my kids were growing up, but by high-school it dropped out of main sports and basketball/football took over.", " I played in school and in a summer league as a young child, but other sports drew my attention as I grew. It amazes me that it remains the most popular sport in the world. No equipment required helps.", " Yes, a world sport so a lot of smaller summing larger than our outlay. Did you see where the football or basketball coach is highest paid state employee in 39 of 50 states, sad priorities in my book.", " Well I assume your in the US, we don't follow any sports are team isn't in contention to win and we have a whole bunch of sports year round. A lot of the countries in the World Cup that the only game in town for months so it dominates the press.", " I do!

Certainly better than inventing a sports drink!", " Agreed. I think amazon should invent a sports drink lol. Maybe not. They are so rich right now. Bezos is buys building clocks in mountains!", " I dont. i do like basketball though. it is a fun sport.", " Did you know basketball is a team sport? How many players are on each team usually?\\", " hi how are you? do you like sports?", " I do like sports yeah, swimming is one of my favorite ones. ", " hi how are you? do you like sports?", " I do, any favorite sports?", " that is good. those are good sports. i never liked swimming much. ", " You dont? I guess its a boring sport I am a fan but because of Michael Phelps he makes the game exciting", " he is a great swimmer. i prefer team sports more. how many medals has phelps won?", " I think thats unfair, if the other players cant do it then thats no reason to ban that wonderful move from the sport", " I used to watch it back in the 80s before it exploded in popularity.  The Turkish national sport is oil wrestling where they douse themselves in olive oil and then wrestle!  lol  I have to get running.  It was nice chatting with you!", " You know, they have twin versions of the White Hose in Ireland and France?  I wonder if they are sporting solar panels too?", " I am a Prime Member. I get my orders in two days. I love it. I don't have transportation of my own so it is important to me. Walmart is good too-but not as fast and cheap as Amazon. And their Customer Service is good too.", " Wow really?  That's a different way of collecting votes. It's been a while since I voted.  Last time I did it was on the NBA website.  It's a popularity vote i guess.  I like other stats like defensive player of the year.  Based on more stats but is that also voted on by sports writers?", " I know some like, The Raven and Annabelle Lee. Did you realize that Poetry was once an Olympic sport?", " I agree, if chess is a sport then art and music should be considred as events.", " Yeah, kind of like a classy sort of club sport. I wonder why they aren't called tennis shirts then since polo players adopted them later. ", " That's a good theory and probably true. Many sports names are Animal names, and its pretty awesome to know there are about 20 quintillion individual animals on earth. that's alot.", " Well I do like beer. Haha. It's only 4:44 am here and I have learned so many new things today. Air jordans banned from the nba but jordan wearing them anyway and nike just paying the fine each game.  There sure is alot of money in sports.", " I like Always sunny. The first 2 seasons were brilliant. Love them. I watch a lot of live sports. It's a little bit of an obsession. Also can be a pain...", " Yeah those first seasons were the best by far.  I am the same, I mostly watch sports live or I use my DVR because I work nights.  My fav baseball team was one game away from the series, and my fav basketball team is the best in the league right now. ", " Not really but i appreciate the sport. How about you? ", " Yes. lol  I'm not sure.  Why do they wear them?  I think it's the only sport where the managers do wear uniforms.", " I cant imagine that would have provided much fun.  The NFL is technically an entertainment rather than a sport legally.", " Yeah it's the best thing out of Canada (well I guess they like lacrosse too since that is one of their national sports as well).", " I moved recently but I used to love the San Jose Sharks. They are alright; it doesn't get very cold in California, so it makes sense that ice hockey rings often can be converted to basketball courts so it's useful for two different sports and two different seasons.", " Yeah and people don't just love driving cars, people race them too. Car racing has become a super popular sport. In fact a guy named Jann Mardenborough became a professional race car driver by winning a competition on the racing video game Gran Turismo.", " Yes, I  do.  It's hard to find public transportation in our area.", " The dutch people have public transport that goes up to 160MPH!!!!!", " Yep I wish I could see how they made a computer in Minecraft, that actually sounds cool, have you ever played the game of softball by the way? I'm too lazy to play sports myself", " I think the USA has shifted its focus more onto contact sports.", " Another slow sport is fishing. I know people like to watch competitive fishing, I can't see the excitement myself.  I could imagine catching fish but not watching.", " Cats are definitely more independent than dogs.  Most dogs just want to love everyone.  Do you ever have your dog play any kind of sport or game?", " I was curious because I read something about teaching dogs to swim. Apparently it's not as easy with a Labradoodle as with a smart sport breed like a Vizsla!", " Because they are part of the team? I think it's weird that other sports managers don't wear uniforms. ", " Yes it is actually called soccer-baseball as it has elements from both sports", " The FIBA basketball World Cup and the Men's Olympic basketball tournaments are the major international events of the sport.

I did not know that - basketball is such a huge sport - in 39 states a basketball or football coach is the highest paid state employee", " Well let me tell you I played Hockey in my youth but I never lost weight. But then again field Hockey for kids is a sport, today's hockey clubs (pro) are big business. Did you every play?", " Gosh that sounds like fun... until ya fall  lol. Maybe they could add that as an Olympic sport....", " We did this while drinking,  I dont think it can be an olympic sport lol ", " Ah I see that sounds like a good idea to be honest.  To ban civilian vehicles and create privatized public transportation.  I bet it is very nice to live there.", " Why would traveling by car get expensive? I don't think I would travel by car there since they have a great public transportation system. It'd also be dangerous since the roads are the opposite of the US.", " Yesh. Did you knoe literature was an olympic sport?", " Wow, that's interesting!  But how about a gold metal?  The father of the modern Olympics won a gold metal for writing poems about sports!", " I think i heard that didn't he write about sports? ", " I used to love kickball. It makes sense because it is a mixture of those sports but it is easier to keep it just one word.", " Did not know that, interesting. I also did not know until late that it is a super popular sport in Japan", " Yes, we would need birth certificates and passports for new planets. A brave new world!", " Are you a football fan (soccer)?  Over 250 million players in over 200 countries play being the most popular sport in the world", " I guess that part about soccer making more money than any sport is true. Yet, I've never seen a pro game in the U.S. ", " The ones I knew who could do fly sank like a rock with breast.  But neither equates to golf.    VanDyken was my personal know.  She was great at overplaying her sportsmanship qualities.  :)", " Well, in my opinion, her comeback to everyday life as paraplegic is more inspiring than recovering from a run-of-the-mill sports injury like Bryce Hunter.", " Yes, especially since even though baseball is demanding in terms of time, it does not ruin your body  or brain the way some other sports like football can. I don't think molestation or eating disorders are common in the sport, either.", " At least, not in the MLB.  I would suspect that would be more common in the softball world, or in female oriented professional sports.", " Well, the disparity of proper treatment for females in sports isn't just physical, it's professional, too, in the sense that there's literally one pro spectator sport in the world where women are considered professionally equal to men (tennis).", " Yeah that is interesting. On a different not soccer brings in more money then all other major sports combined. ", " I love fantasy, creativity flies, do you play fantasy sports?", " I like TV and sports. Did you know managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams? Can you imagine Bobby V trying to hit?", " I have not.  I did live in Turkey, however.  Soccer is popular there but no other team sports to speak of.  I wonder if that's why there are so many star Japanese baseball players within the leagues?  Who is your favorite pitcher -- any team?  ", " Possibly, it is a combat sport after all.", " Have you ever wrestled? I never have. It seems like a challenging sport.", " Really? I was shocked. I guess I don't understand economics of the famous. I thought sports people were paid too much per game, plus their annual contract.", " I guess it depends on the sport too. do you like radio dramas?", " I think it would be interesting to see American teams play against Japanese teams, since both countries are such fans of the sport!", " I wonder if they transported that piano there in whole one piece or in smaller pieces and then assembled it ?", " I think it was something about space aliens and two FBI fellows that hunt them for profit and sport.", " That is a good point. Without a car, do you walk a lot, or take public transportation?", " I take public transportation or taxi's and you?", " That seems to make sense. I wonder if many hold onto it though. There seems to be a lot of fines in pro sports. Do you know how many teams are in the NBA?", " I think that was really smart on his part. A career in pro sports only lasts for so long and unless you become a household name endorsements aren't guaranteed. It becomes necessary to have a backup plan and he went about it in a good way. ", " That's surprising, it seems like the focus on athletes isn't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master's degree, is very surprising to me.", " What I sometimes find most entertaining about baseball is the drama between the coaches / managers and the umpires.  It adds another dimension to the baseball you do not get in other sports.  Are you into drama shows, either live, TV or movie?", " Yeah what a fortune. In Japan it is a super popular sport", " I know it was awarded for everything else. There was a gold medal won for literature written about sports. ", " Really? No i did not know about that. I know the US has the most gold medals in the world in this sport.", " Hi, do you play any fantasy sports?", " I'm not sure. That sounds a bit scary lol. But still very impressive they have invented that. Transportation seems to be changing all over the world.

I started playing Supermario Bros back when Mario was too small to have a mouth, and thus sports his prominent mustachio!", " I think a game close to Cricket is played in most other countries except the US where football reigns in the sports arena as the national pastime.", " Football is extremely popular in America which is probably why those with successful careers in sports are often associated with celebrity status. ", " That's really good!  Did you know that soccer makes more money that football and baseball combined with other sports?", " Considering its the worlds most popular sport with 250 million players in over 200 countries its not too surprising", " I believe it since it is a world sport! We only call it soccer because it's slang for association football!", " Wow, yeah soccer is a popular sport it's played by 250 M players over 200 countries and dependencies. ", " Yes it is the worlds most popular sport!!, remember Ozil, from Germany?", " No, tell me about him. Soccer makes more money than all other major sports combined. Man that's a lot of bread, lol.", " It's such a global sport. I heard that is makes more money than all other professional sports combined.", " Wow! I guess it makes sense for the world's most popular sport to be the one that makes the most money! ", " Wow did you know that Soccer makes more money than all other popular sports combined ?", " Interesting! So do you watch sports on tv?", " I love sports and history. The united states got 3rd place in the first fifa world cup in 1930.", " Yes I agree. He is already so rich. I think he should get involved with soccer because it makes more money than most other sports combined!", " Was it France? Oh sorry, my bad. I think I was looking at the wrong games. Did you know that soccer makes the most money out of any sport?", " I know, especially where there is so little kicking in that game.  Soccer makes more money than most pro sports combined,", " It's because it's played so many places. It's so much bigger then other sports. People play in over 200 countries!", " I'm a casual fan.  It makes more money though than all of the big sports like football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis, and hockey combined.  That's incredible and shows how popular it is around the world!", " I agree. Just out of curiosity, do you enjoy any other forms of entertainment like sports?", " i do like some sports.  I watched a little of the FIFA world cup last year.  It was interesting to see it in Russia. DId you watch any of it?", " I imagine you are right about that.  Soccer is extremely popular.  It makes more money than football and some other sports combined.", " It is strange though that the US has performed so amazingly at the world cup so consistently over the years despite other sports like golf or football being more popular in the us", " I know what you mean.  Most people in the country prefer other sports and yet the soccer team has never placed below third place in the womens world cup.", " Hi, do you like watching any sports?", " They play outside, so no air conditioning. But Qatar is hot. I suppose they'll play in domes. I know the top soccer players make a lot. Not sure if it's more than the other sports. ", " The women's team does better than the men's team, for sure!  Hard to believe that France won the world cup in 2018. A sport as popular globally, and little old France beat everyone!", " Not at all! Haha! I had never heard of soccer until I got out of high school. It's strange to me that it makes more money than all other sports combined.", " Thats interesting. Do you watch any sports on tv?", " I can't believe it's only been 44 years since the drive through was invented! We depend on cars so much today. Can you imagine what it was like when people depended on horses for transport?", " Some parts of the world still utilize animals for transport, be it a horse or mule or other. I think it would be cool to ride around on an elephant.", " Most cars don't usually reach that speed, much less a pitcher. It's incredible what the human body can do with the kind of training that sports requires!", " I guess it is, its a sport with many curious facts like Don Mattingly a Yankees player that got suspended for a crazy reason, want to know what that reason is?", " Not really... I'm more of a sports fan like the MLB and delving into things like the Yankees \"lost player\"", " Yes, some Japanese fans do not know the sport is America's national pastime.", " It makes sense I guess, but that's a real mouthful to say!  I don't know about kickball, but baseball is definitely a sport that seemed made for radio.  It's like a drama playing out over the radio waves. ", " Very true, do you ever watch sports?", " I do watch some sports, usually around championship time. You?", " I'm an avid reader. I haven't read many sports books, but I love fantasy and sci-fi works. Starship Troopers is next on my list to read.", " Yeah that is pretty amazing actually. Do you know who invented the sport?", " No, I have not. And I watch a ton of sports!", " Wow cool. Did you know that the sport was invented at the YMCA", " That is pretty sad!  I hope he gets royalties or something,  the sport has blown up!  ", " Do you play fantasy?  I hear people fantasy draft spelling bees lol I always thought it was just sports lol ", " No,  I unfortunately do not keep up with sports much,  except snowboarding lol ", " I love snowboarding,  pretty obsessed with it,  I have to go at least twice a week in the winter time!  You should try it!  Its hard at first but all sports are lol ", " That was really smart. You never know in sports if you are going to have a short career. He made sure he had something to fall back on.", " Yea, that's crazy! NBA players have the highest average salary in sports", " How true!  Did you know the Turkish national sport is oil wrestling?  Men douse themselves with olive oil and then wrestle.", " I still have cable, but only because I watch a lot of live sports. ", " Very interesting! I wonder if it was a smart move after all...I heard Kim Jong Un's half brother used to be the one going to be the heir but when he tried to enter Tokyo Disneyland with a fake passport that dream was smashed!", " I'm not.  I respect the sport.  I do know that Canada is the only country with 2 national sports: lacrosse and ice hockey", " i do not follow hockey. i do not understand the sport.", " LOL An ice hockey rink remains under a basketball court when switching stadium sports.  Amazing how they can change the floors like they do.", " Yes.  Canada is the only country in the world with two national sports - lacrosse and ice hockey!", " That is unusual, but canada has extreme seasons. i figure that they need a sport for hot and cold.", " Hi, it is crazy for sure. Are you only a football fan or a fan of other sports too?", " No clue! Baseball really is weird. Maybe they thought she'd be bad for the sport or something?", " I do watch it.  I'm a baseball fan.  The sport has been declining in popularity for years now.  So that doesn't suprise me.", " Speaking of games and sports, what do you think about baseball? I personally think it's incredibly boring", " Yes I would love to see that! That could be a sport unto itself. what do you think about the guy who found millions of dollars a baseball cards in his attic?", " Well good strategy to market I guess.  Hockey is the national sport of Canada along with lacrosse.", " Hello there, are you a fan of fantasy sports? ", " Yeah always a team sport, but on offense the QB does run the show and always will.  ", " I am a big football fan.  I played QB in high school and still follow the sport", " I didn't know that! Although I am not surprised that it was removed as they are not sports. Did you know that Two identical twins from japan released a rap album when they turned 100 years old in 1992?", " Pretty cool. Literature used to be an Olympic sport, I wonder why it is not anymore", " To tell you the truth, I think that the Olympic should be for sports only.  It was included in the Olympic events from 1912 to 1952.", " no I have not. Speaking about soccer , it is payed in over 200 countries and is the most popular sport in the world ", " interesting, soccer also makes the most money compared to other sports like football and baseball ", " Slang?  It was the official title of the sport for all of my years... It seems to have Muslim ties in some parts of the world.  ", " How's it going? Have you've ever played golf, a popular club and ball sport?", " Ha! That's hard to believe, isn't it? Well speaking of sports, do you watch soccer? I can't believe a team once scored an own goal deliberately to advance in a cup match!", " I think it's pretty crazy that John Stewart even played a sport. Ha! That's cool, though! But then again, I also find it unbelievable that the super bowl itself is smaller than the third largest soccer event.", " That is wild. I never knew that and always assumed football was the richest sport! I'll have to make a few calls and tell people about that. Ha! Speaking of phones, can you believe that there's really no correlation between connection quality and service bars?", " I have not.  Is it good?  I typically just watch music videos and sports highlights on YouTube.  I think it is tremendous we have a site where regular people can upload content.", " Watch Formula 1 and other sports highlights, too. Also like individual sites, like the silent videos an Australian guy puts up showing Primitive Technology, his show title. How to build a hut or clay firing kiln - with only materials around you - and all stone age, handmade tools...Sound like something you'd like?", " Yeah. DO you know who invented the sport?", " You a big fan of basketball?  Admittedly, that was more my brother's gig than mine, but I do find some things about it fascinating.  For instance, they say Kim Jong Un was obsessed with the sport and spent hours drawing Michael Jordan!  Weird, huh?", " going back to money, being a coach is also a lucrative field.  I'm told in 39 of 50 states the top paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach.  Again, makes me wish I had a head for sports strategy.  ", " Yes, I love cars.  Let's start with the definition.  A car or automobile is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.  Most definitions of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods. ", " Oh really?  I didnt know that he played volleyball as well.  Is that a popular sport in north korea?", " I had no idea! Our family is really into the sport. There is nothing like being at the ballpark! Can you believe a man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball card in his grandfathers house?! What a lucky guy!", " Seriously! I prefer to read than watch sports. There is a lady that can read 4700 words per minute!", " I am in Iowa so kind of lol, we don't have a sports team close to us. White Sox have been down, I don't mind the cubs though lol", " lol we have that you're right. Not doing so hot in basketball though. Do you collect sports cards?", " Oh I did not know that, interesting. softball was also the first sport ing event shown in espn.", " I had no idea the YMCA invented softball. That is very cool! I wonder if softball was always intended to be more of a women's sport, like it is now.", " Exactly, and softball is actually a tougher sport to win with slightly different rules than in baseball. There is less time to get to the bases.", " True! Also the first sporting event ever shown on ESPN was a slow pitch softball game, so many must love the game.", " I have loved it too as far back as I can remember. I played on a league a few years back and it was so fun. The name softball was given to the sport in 1926 because the ball was actually soft, it feels pretty hard when you get hit with it haha", " I would be in my REM cycle on inning 10 haha. Did you know the first sporting event on ESPN was a slow pitch softball game?", " Yeah. It is a sport that has more money than some other combined", " I agree, it makes me like the sport more hearing that kind of stuff. Are you into tennis at all?", " Hi, do you enjoy tennis?  Let's start off with a definition.  Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players (doubles).", " Tennis is a cool sport and apparently one can learn it quickly.  US Open quarter-finalist Gael Monfils beat the \"Roger Federer of paddle tennis\" after learning how to play just days earlier.", " Really? That is insane, I know it is the largest sport, but not that large. Our American womens soccer team is very good though!", " Well, soccer is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries making it the world's most popular sport!", " I didn't either. Did you know that The turkish national sport is oil wrestling where men douse themselves in olive oil and then wrestle.", " I actually had heard before he was a wrestler, though I didn't know he had participated in that many matches. It is crazy to me how big that sport once was in the United States.", " That is what I am saying is it is just crazy throughout history how big this sport has been. I wonder what will need to happen to bring it back, or if it is kind of gone for good?", " That is fascinating. In Turkey oil wrestling is a national sport.", " Oh so youre a soccer fan thats great I also love the sport, crazy how MySpace had the chance to buy the company at pennies for the dollar", " Cars are so fundamental to our lives. I think that we would not be able to live without transportation.", " ...but that future is coming fast... look at the PC sports at events like Intel Extreme when young people fight between each other in war strategic games like starcraft ! Those kids have master skills in controlling an armies ! ;) ", " Hi I love to travel!! Any type of transportation and always eager to try something new!", " Wow that is interesting, especially seeing how it was in worse times for civil rights for sure. What's your favorite sport?", " That's crazy! Serena is incredible, I also feel that it's a relatively even sport with opportunity for anyone to win.", " I agree, it definitely gets long. I used to think football was slow and boring, that's why basketball is my favorite sport!", " No, I'm not a sports person at all. Are you a fan?", " Hello there, I wouldn't say I'm a fan but I do think she is really good and dominates that sport, how about you?", " I have other favorite sports but I do like it, its a game with a lot of history", " Oh I guess Nike is a company with the resources, most sports brands are, like Reebok, did you hear about the deal Iverson signed with them?", " I don't know Roman Polak. I know Roman Polanski. Hockey is one of Canada's national sports. There is another one. Can you guess what it is?", " I read a lot..mainly autobiography's, history books, and sports related book.  Did you know that Starship Troopers is the first sci-fi novel on the reading lists of 3 of the 5 US military branches?", " the sport is exciting and flows well, but it has become too expensive for the average person. The college game is probably the same. ", " I wonder if that gave him an advantage.  If I invented a sport I'd make sure it suited me one hundred percent.", " I guess thats why chess is one of the most challenging games/sport out there, do you like to play chess, know how to play it?", " Yes he is an NBA player whose sister was always better than him at the sport", " Yeah. DO you know who invented the sport?", " ya, are you a college sports fan? I actually don't like sports I don't watch any of that stuff", " Oh I just listen to sports podcasts, mainly basketball ones. I did not know that. Have you ever been to a pink floyd concert?", " I have not but they are a favorite band of mine. What basketball podcast? I love sports podcasts so we're on the same page...", " I listen to BBallbreakdown NBA podcast. Basketball is my favorite sport so that's why I listen to it. ", " Love Carol Burnett, actually, from her 70's show, to appearances on Sesame Street, right up to today. How about you? Any sports celebrities your favorites?", " Agreed. And to answer your last question, I am unfamiliar with many sports celebrities. However, I am a fan of Tom Brady!", " I admire his longevity and his great skill throwing a football. What I don't like is that, as a celebrity sports figure, he's become almost a messiah-type figure to NE fans. ", " Hmm, that's something to consider. Another thing to consider is their transportation. Mackinac island only has carriages and bikes.", " I do, its one of my favorite sports, coaches have a high salary", " Nope it's actually either the college football or basketball coach. That seems like a waste of money to me but again I don't like sports", " I do it's a very good sport. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar didn't seem to have a problem with dunking on the hoop though.", " It is strange that the creator of the sport, Naismith was the only losing coach in the university of kansas' history.", " Nice, yeah me too. Do you know who invented the sport?", " Yeah and also the only losing U of Kansas coach in the sport", " I guess the dollars from TV, advertisers and alumni drive up the salaries. It's a shame that sports dominates college.", " I would guess its because it makes the transportation of the piano easier, kind of like the paino that was found on top of  the tallest mountain of Britain", " did you know that soccer worldwide makes more than all over sports combined?", " ya I'm from Michigan and I've been there, I'm allergic to horses and that is the only allowed mode of transportation, I didn't like it haha", " It does. it is the worlds most popular sport. people all over the world follow teams and watch the world cup.", " It's the sport of the people. It makes more money that the other major sports combined. ", " Don't know. Probably because there was already a sport called football, they needed something new. The variation of soccer with 3 teams sounds weird. I wonder why that was started.", " I usually only watch live sports and the occassional movie. I find that I can work with sports on in the background and still keep focus on what I need to do. There's 62 laps left so 138...", " That's why it's sports and not something by stanley kubrick!", " Yes, they still use it as a concert venue in Croatia. There are many different kinds of concerts from private houses and small nightclubs to dedicated concert hall, arenas and parks to large multipurpose building and even sports stadiums. I really like the sports stadium concerts myself.", " HA! I know how expensive sporting shoes are so I really hope they're cheap!", " How are you? Been to any concerts lately? I went to one at a park but want to go to one at a sports stadium one day", " Hi! Not so much as other sports, but I do often wonder how in the world do they wash those uniforms so clean after sliding in dirt!", " I finally realized my kids is never going to like playing any sport, he would be more interested in collecting the cards.", " Yes. Its Very popular all over the world. But Basketball, baseball and the NFL dominate sports in America.", " Yeah, and it's kind of funny because soccer actually pays more than all those sports.", " Yes. Its crazy money that sports people make these days.", " The Silent Saturday sports movement is big in D.C.", " That is pretty funny. Did you watch the Super Bowl by the way? I know that I did. What's also crazy is that soccer makes more money than every other sport in the world combined, I don't even know that's possible", " It's amazing how popular it is, but it is practically the only sport that has a global following. Some players can go to completely different countries and be recognized, like Wayne Rooney.", " That sounds like the football version of four-way chess! I played that once and it was a mess. I bet professionals handle a three-way sport match better, though.", " In any case, soccer is an amazing sport. It is too bad Greenland can't join fifa since there isn't enough grass for a soccer field", " I actually like. Did you know it is the most profitable sport?", " I think it's soccer right? Apparently it makes more than all other sports combined? What do you think about soccer though?", " Yep you're right about that. It makes more than all other sports come by and somehow haha. But like I said I think it's really boring. Did you ever watch the show the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart? Apparently he was a big soccer player back in the 80s", " It's certainly a popular sport. More than 250 million people play all around the world.", " Hello,  do you play fantasy sports? I hear people even fantasy spelling bees lol", " hi how are you? i dont know how to play fantasy sports.", " Baseball is the one of the favourite sports of US. In mid of 1850 baseball is the craze hit in the New York area.", " It also American's national pastime. It is derived from the cricket which the national sports in England.", " I have, but it's been a long time. I'm not a big fan of most professional sports, but I know how it works. The Supreme Court really likes is though since their top floor has a basketball court", " Was James Naismith part of the YMCA? He invented basketball, and I know at some point he was a coach at the University of Kansas. I'm not sure which sport he coached, but he lost", " Great point - seems more like a missile than public transportation.", " That is correct. I just recently discovered that basketball and volleyball were invented at the YMCA. That makes those sports newer than I thought or the YMCA older than I thought. ", " It is called soccer-baseball which seems quite fitting considering what the sport is like", " At least they have transportation - Iceland does not even have trains available", " No I had no idea about that. I travelled on the bullet train when I was in japan and that is the fastest land transportation I have ever used. Yeah, I love travelling.", " I mean, they still claim planes are the safest mode of transportation. As per Japan, it is so true that you have to pay for every road you use, but honestly their infrastructure is crazy good", " I wouldn't either.  I'd likely have to rely on other forms of transportation if that were the case here.", " Yea James Naismith, ironic he invented the sport and then lost most of the games at the University of Kansas", " It must have been hard for him, you invent a sport then everyone is better than you. I wonder if he regretted inventing it. Thanks for the conversation, have a good day. ", " It is a very entertaining sport to play and watch. Some men go so far that vasectomy rates increase during march madness to get some rest days to watch basketball.", " Yes he was the jam master, he's a legend of the sport. ", " Wow but i guess that makes since the sports produces a lot of money. didn't the dunk get banned because of Kareem? ", " I think that's one of the greatest questions in sports.  Good players go to the good teams through a crazy series of trades.  I liked the good old days when a player stayed with one team for a long time.  Random question - do you know what the Granny style of throwing is?", " I got into the wrong line of work I guess, that seems like a lot of money to make for someone who hasn't played in like 10 years. DO you watch any other sports other than basketball?", " Agreed on both counts!  As much fun as it is watching the games I still think that there is entirely too much money wrapped up in pro sports.  The fact that a team like the Warriors can lose 12 million in one game is just crazy.", " Why do you think those sports are so popular in the States and baseball has a hard time finding an audience?", " I also feel like baseball doesn't have a big figure like Lebron James or Michael Jordan. I just saw that Jordan wore his Air Jordan's even though they were banned, and Nike paid the fine. Who do you think is the closest person to Lebron James in the NFL, in terms of being a spokesperson for the sport? Tom Brady?", " That doesn't seem that old, but in sports years that may be fairly old. ", " It was an event with music, painting, architecture and others from 1912 to 1952, then they decisded it wasnt an olympic sport I guess", " Not olympic sports are actually sports", " Chess is an olympic sport and I dont see that game as much of sport so who knows, I think sculpture might qualify", " Could be, but its not much of a sport either, do you know who Winsont Churchill is?", " Well depends how you define sport I guess. Anyway, yes I do. Why?", " It is quite a peculiar sport, I know that japanese fans are surprised by the fact that Baseball is the National sport of the U.S.", " Seems clunky - kickball makes sense and describes the sport pretty accurately I think.  Why don't they call hockey soccer-ice skating with sticks?", " Yeah I occasionally watch a hockey game. Canada only has 2 national sports lacrosse and hockey.", " an ice hockey ring remains under a basketball court when switching stadium sports. I think I could watch basketball if they left the ice on the court, could be entertaining then.", " They are really good, but that is to be expected as it is one of their national sports.", " Yes they live and breathe it! Lacrosse is their other national sport.", " It is an Olympic sport, and it is played in lots of leagues all over the world. so maybe they will.", " Yes I agree. Definitely longer than the NFL I would think. College sports are hugely popular. In 39 out of 50 states, the highest paid employee is a college football or basketball coach.", " Good talking to you about sports.", " 160 mph sounds like a really fast commuter bus. I don't think other countries have a transportation means like that one sounds a bit dangerous. ", " Good Morning!  Basketball is my 3rd favorite sport, but at least March Madness and the NBA playoffs are coming up!", " 30 teams, 29 American and the other one Canadian, great sport, 5 vs 5 one court two sides", " I do its a team sport which commonly has 5 players per team. Shoot a basketball into a defenders hoop", " Agreed. Public transportation is widely available. However, driving has its perks. Like drive-thrus for example. Mcdonald's added drive-thrus in 1975 for soldiers that couldn't get out of their cars.", " Do you like Jon Hamm? He plays in the Transporter movies and recently in the Fast and Furious movies.", " I'm not sure I know basketball is very important to people. In fact in 39 out of 50 states it's actually the highest paid state employee is a college football or basketball coach.  People like there sports.", " I didn't realize that.  It's a team sport.", " Yes!  lol I hope he gets royalties or something because this sport generates a lot of money!", " Do you like basketball?  Of the 4 professional sports leagues in the US, I'd have to rank it at number two for me.", " I'm not such a sport fan but I'd have to say basketball is my favorite! It is fast paced but easy to follow.", " That's a shame he couldn't win at games, but he won at inventing a sport!  ", " I hadn't heard of that. That's interesting. When you aren't watching sports, do you like to watch movies? ", " Well, it is an Olympic sport, although it seems like an unfair fight when 29 of the NBA's 30 teams are in the US and it's the premier league in the world haha", " that makes sense. i bet basketball is a huge sport in that setting too. football is big in texas because they go lots of space. in ny, its basketball.", " I love dogs too.  I can see how they could be used for therapy.  They have been used to help sports stars like J R Smith...", " Yes, that is an excellent point.  I honestly just use YouTube for sports videos and music.  Do you like basketball?", " Yes, basketball is my favorite sport!", " I couldn't live somewhere where I couldn't drive around if I wanted to. I wonder what kind of transportation King Kalakaua used when he travelled around the world? Probably not horses or bikes. ", " I really enjoy watching Formula 1 and sometimes NASCAR, but I'm not that into normal cars per se.  I do appreciate them as a for of transportation but some people go way overboard on customizing them - like flame-throwers to prevent carjacking!", " Its not my favorite sport, but yes.  I think it is neat that Lincoln was an amazing wrestler.   I never would have guessed that!", " Me either, it's so popular in the rest of the world and somehow barely gets mentioned in America.  It makes more money than a bunch of other sports combined.", " I bet his team mates were really angry at him or maybe not Babe Ruth is one of the biggest legends of the sport. ", " I wonder why they have higher television ratings. Most people prefer to watch men's sports.", " I would have never thought that. Football isnt considered a sport its considered entertainment, and I totally wouldve thought that made more money", " Sure. I am a big sports fan. Baseball, basketball and football", " The demand is there. The kids love it. Do you follow sports at all?", " I do, I like soccer, what about you? do you follow any sports?", " I try to watch the World Cup. The sport is so popular! Soccer makes more money than football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and hockey combined.", " I agree with you, they do earn a lot of money so they can do it, do you like to play or watch any other sports?", " I've played it, but I'm not very good. Both volleyball and basketball were invented at the YMCA. Gym sports are popular at the Y.", " That's crazy! On another note, do you ever watch sports on TV?", " Not really, I prefer TV for news and entertainment, not so much for sports and especially not for advertising.", " I am not a big fan of  tennis. I do not understand the sport. Anyway, great chat!", " Well I guess it is because those sports are very popular and generate a lot of revenue and publicity for the state?", " Yeah I'm sure that is true, just like how pro sports bring in money for all kinds of things. ", " I've never watched it either. I don't personally like soccer a lot. I don't know why it is the most popular World sport that seems insane haha", " Right but I think it just cost so much money that you just never recoup it. Or at least that's what I've been told. Did you know that soccer makes more than all other sports in the world combined. Even American football", " I do not. I'm not a sports fan, but I do know that soccer brings in more revenue than all of the American sports, combined.", " I like sports and I was not much into soccer, until recently. I watch the World cup. I find it very in", " I love soccer!  Its probably my favorite sport!", " Haha!  Well I'm from the US, I guess we are born with baseballs?  I'm not sure!  I guess soccer makes more money than any other sport combined, that's pretty impressive!", " Yes, I think soccer is the most popular sport everywhere except in the US.  What is your favorite team?", " Not really... I liked sports games like basketball.  Did you know that in 39 of 50 states the highest paid state employee is either a football or basketball coach?", " I believe that, our states are crazy about college sports. Did you know the creator of basketball was the most losing coach in Kansas history", " That is crazy!     Then again, any sport which resorts to using a helicopter to dry the surface must be!", " Well every sport have their fair share of bizarre facts. Did you also know that grunting before hitting the tennis ball is considered by some to be cheating and that the longest rally was 643 consecutive shots.", " I do not have a car. I use public transportation and do not have to shovel snow anymore.", " Hi, do you have a means of transportation like a car?", " I was about to say I wish they had dancing with the horses, but I guess equestrian sports are close! I did see dancing with dogs on a talent show. I go honor my Granny and listen to a country song now for old times sake!", " I have to go with my home team the Az Diamondbacks, how about you? I agree Baseball is a great sport!", " Oooh, I've always wanted to play guitar. I dabbled in flute in school but the instrument is probably laying in the basement somewhere. I preferred sports like basketball.", " I don't think I see players sporting Air Jordan's now, are they still banned? Well even when they were banned, Nike was willing to pay the fine for each game. That fine was probably a lot cheaper than marketing the shoes.", " That would be sweet to play on.  I find it a little sad the amounts that are paid to people playing sports or musicians.  In 39 out of 50 states, the college football or basketball coach is the highest paid employee.  I guess you can see where our societies priorities lie.", " College education is one of the main reasons that a lot of college athletes really pursue their sport. I know a couple of friends who wanted to stop their sport (swimming), but had to keep doing it for scholarship reasons. Of course, they didn't have the opportunity to go on to be professional, like Duncan did. Are you actually a basketball fan, or are a lot of the facts here new to you?", " Oh, you used to play? In a league, or just casually with friends? Yeah, I don't know anything about the sport. You could tell me the net was 15 feet off the ground and I'd believe you. Most of my experience was from elementary school P.E. classes, so, you know, ten feet to a 4-foot-tall kid seems pretty high. Do know the scoring at least -- though I didn't know a normal basket was called a \"field goal,\" which was a new term to me.", " Yeah I would have assumed it would have been American football, or yeah soccer would make sense too. But you weren't going for the big bucks when choosing basketball--just for the love of sport. Were any of the teams you were on part of USAB, which is recognized by FIBA? Or is USAB more professional stuff?", " I agree. Nothing wrong with an education. I did not know that the NBA was one of four major professional sports leagues in the US and Canada. Somehow I thought there were more.", " Yes. DO you know who invented the sport?", " Haha my question exactly. Well sports are huge in this country no doubt. 39 out of the top 50 paid employees in the states are either a college football or basketball coach!", " The NBA is my favorite professional sports league. I am a fan of the New York Knicks & grew up idolizing Allen Iverson.", " I agree. It's ridiculous. We put too much emphasis on sports at that point. Did you know that the supreme court building has a basketball court?", " Yes, basketball is a global sport & very popular, especially in Europe & China. Unfortunately New Zealand has a team name with racial undertones.", " I didn't know that.  It was a fun movie when I saw it as a kid.  I probably shot hoops for the rest of the week after seeing it.  That's just how sports movies affect me.", " yeah, great at inventing games, not so good at coaching them. Now the sport is huge at the college level. In 39 out of 50 states, the highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach.", " The NBA athletes are paid better than in the other sports", " Interesting! What about sports, do you research them too?", " Nah, they don't really interest me at all. Are you a sports fan?", " Well, it's certainly a skill I can appreciate even if I don't enjoy the sport.", " Do you like sports", " I only like basketball. Do you like any sports?", " I like most sports from basketball to football", " It is a shame that James Naismith who invented basketball is more well know for being the only losing coach in Kansas U's history rather than making what is arguable among the most popular sports", " Wow that is quite the feat for a state employee. I guess people really love their sports. ", " That is pretty funny. Imagine being horrible at the amazing sport you invented!? Kind of a bittersweet victory. ", " I do, the Wizards are my favorite team, do you like the sport?", " Oh, that makes sense! Haha, even the government has a sense of humor about sports.", " I think it's great that college basketball gives a chance to young people to advance in sports and get a chance at that kind of life.", " I figure there's too much money in the college game. The players make nothing. The sport is a distraction to the mission of a university.", " I agree totally.  I have two kids that will have to go to college, I don't want my fees going to pay for a sports coach.", " No, I lack height, coordination, speed and only dribble with one hand so it wasn't a sport for me. I do enjoy March Madness as I went to Kansas and they're usually winners early in the tournament. Funny Air Jordans were banned by the league, but Jordan himself wore them anyway. Nike couldn't have paid for that much press had they not banned them.", " I have read that one before.  It's pretty cool.  The history of poetry is interesting as well.  I like that Vikings were considered warrior-poets and that poetry was once an Olympic sport.  ", " Car is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.", " I actually rarely watch the NBA... or any sport for that matter! Do you watch? And if so, who is your favorite team/player?", " It is back to that multiplier thing.  How much revenue does the sport bring in and how much less would it be with a bad coach?", " NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player. I thought that other sports like soccer in the UK would pay more. But I guess NBA has a world following.", " Maybe cause they have the most games? It's only one of four major professional sports leagues in the US.", " I always wondered why Soccer is not one of those sports...", " Exactly. I also wonder why there is only 1 Candian team in the NBA. Is the sport just not popular in Canada?", " Some would say I watch way too much sports. I do know that the Rockets pushed the warriors to a game 7 and if they had James Harden, they may have won the series and not Golden State.", " That's very upsetting to me. We are placing way too much emphasis on sports at that point. ", " No, that's cool. You don't hear too much about 2 sport players anymore like Bo Jackson. I do remember people used to scalp his high school basketball games tickets. They went for over $100 for a high school basketball game!", " The NBA is one of the major professional sports leagues in US and Canada.", " I also like basketball. It is the US favourite past time sports. In 1920 there are many professional basketball team in towns, cities of US. This lead to the growth basketball.", " I was surprised to know that the average pay for a NBA player is the highest  for all professional sports. ", " Being the inventor of a sport, it must be frustrating seeing others doing better than you. ", " Speaking of sports brands, Lebron James rejected a $10 million dollar sponsorship offer from Reebok when he was 18. He was right as less than a year later, Nike offered him $90 million.", " Cleveland felt the same way when he left.  Everything of his was scrubbed from the website, stores, everything.  But NBA players follow the money ... all the way to the highest salaries in all of pro sports.", " I've almost got my full flexibility back.  I couldn't bend it at all for a month, and then only progressed about a degree per week.  It was frustrating.  But, I eventually made it so I can play sports again without fear of pain or falling.  I can run a route and make a lay up like I used to.  2 points!", " Did you know that the all-star break is the only time when there are no pro sports playing in America?  Right around July 4, too.", " no, ive never even heard of it.  i figured there was always a sport playing. they all overlap to an extent", " Hey, Lebron James is a great guy on and off the court. Do you like sports?", " The highest paid sports coaches, or the highest paid employees over all industries?", " Hello - basketball is my 3rd favorite sport, but it's all we have right now!", " I'd have to assume that no one was really good back then.  One of the things I like about Basketball is there are only 5 players on the court per team - it's a small team sport with big players!", " Not as much as the NFL but it is a fascinating sport. Did you know that scientifically granny style is the most accurate method to score points?", " I like the sport because my son plays it in highschool and thats about as much as I really know about it. I love watching him play.", " The basics are that it's a team sport where two teams most commonly made of 5 players per team oppose one another with the goal of shooting baskets.I know Kareem Abdul-Jabar's dominant use of the dunk shot got banned from college BB for over a decade.", " I guess the sport pays great. Lebron James got a $90 million dollar deal from nike when he was only 19", " It looks like the money is in all sports, in 39 out of the 50 states the highest paid state employee is either a college football or college basketball coach.", " Yeah. Do you know who invented the sport?", " This article is interesting. I have always been intrigued with the structure of sports leagues in the United States. There are so fundamentally unique.", " For one, teams outside the United States are allowed to compete, e.g. Canada as the article said. They are also typically considered to be the premier sports leagues in the world.", " In Europe, in soccer all countries compete not only against themselves but against other continents as well. And if I'm not mistaken it's the wealthiest sport on the planet.", " Yes, I mean the NBA. In comparison to soccer teams and leagues which have existed for 200 years, it is fairly young in my opinion. This means that the sport has room to grow.", " lol... do you think basketball can ever become the world's most popular sport?", " Oh wow! I want that kind of money in my life! Haha! In 39 out of 50 states, the highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach! Maybe it's time I go into sports for my job !", " True, although the game has changed many times since James Naismath invented the sport!", " I have no idea. It's incredibly offensive. Well, it's been nice chatting with you about sports today!", " I have watched NBA games on TV. It is a fun and interesting sport.", " A play on the All Blacks. Ha ha. I guess rugby is really the main sport there.", " The NBA is one of the 4 major professional sports leagues in the US, but I am not sure if it is as powerful as the NFL.  I have never been much of a player myself, but I did follow the Bulls when I lived in ChiTown with Michael Jordan.", " I'm not sure.  But the sport is played all over the world and even in some unusual places in the U.S.  The U.S. Supreme Court has its own basketball court on the top floor nicknamed \"the highest court in the land\"!", " It's not my favorite sport, but I hear things about it from time to time. Do you like it?", " Basketball is still a big sport though, so much that men purposely try to get vasectomies near March Madness so they can stay home and watch", " Good day to you. Do you like sports?", " lol. That is what I love about sports, they are usually unpredictable.", " Ha Ha!!! That was funny. Did you know that her first film role was a sports movie?", " Yeah, he could kick back. or he could buy part of a sports franchise.", " Im a big fan of the sport I  really like it and the MLS is getting better as the years go by, it will soon be one of the most popular sports", " That sounds like an interesting variation of the game, I am a fan of the sport but that's new to me", " I guess I am probably missing out. Soccer makes more money than all other major sports combined.", " I guess its because the game is played in more that 200 countries and also has more than 250 million players more than the other sports combined", " Yeah it definitely is the world's most popular sport!", " No, I don't watch football. I'm not very big on sports. As far as association football or soccer, I have at least played it before.", " that is nice. soccer makes so much money now, more than all the other sports combined, well the major ones at least", " That is such a wonderful thing for Mesut Ozil to have done with their bonus! And who knew that Jon Stewart played any sports, let alone such a popular one!", " Neither can I.  But I do remember seeing advertised a TV package with an all soccer channel.  I guess it is needed for die-hard soccer fans since it is not as big a sport in the U.S. compared to international play.  Do you subscribe to cable / dish TV or have you cut the cord?", " I did not know that.  I never mess with my garter snake and she does not mess with me.  If she helps keep the mice and birds from eating my figs, then that is just fine by me.   Often animals are used as sports mascots.  My alma mater is the LSU Tigers.  Do you know of any sports teams with snake mascots?", " I might have to google that later, and yeah I did know about that. Apparently Vans, Nautica, Jansport and other brands are part of the same company.", " I feel positive about the wall, I see nothing wrong with come here legal. Some countries US citizen need legal passports.", " Oh, that Jann Mardenborough? Isn't that crazy? That takes serious talent to be able to beat 90000 people on Gran Turismo and then become a pro racer because of it. Speaking of pro sports, are you into tennis at all?", " Agreed. Plus racing is so much more dangerous than a sport like tennis. Speaking of tennis, did you know there hasn't been a black male US Open winner since 1968 and he was the first and only black male winner?", " I'm not surprised. The game really caters to the wealthy, and there is a wealth gap in the US. In other sports, diversity is not an issue.", " Yes. It is a racked played sports between single opponent or between doubles.", " Tennis is a Olympic sport and it played of all age group of people in the society . The modern tennis originated in England, in late 19th century as Lawn tennis.", " It is very interesting. Ping pong is the company which supply table tennis equipment whereas table tennis is the name of the sport.", " Not at all -- not much of a sports fan at all. Are you?", " I'm on the other side of the spectrum when it comes to sports.  I might do better shooting granny style than the other way.  I read that physicists proved granny style might score more points.  I'm not sure if that's accurate though.", " I like a lot of sports figures, local guys who play for my teams here in Phoenix.  I do not care for many of the reality celebrities - not sure why they are famous for being famous, seems kinda silly", " At least they'll still have Popovich. He's been there for over 20 years, which is pretty rare in professional sports. ", " Yah. And they were two of three number one picks to have ever won a championship in the last 20 years. Just having 1 player isn't enough. It's a team sport!", " I agree! We would go for road trips. We took the car for transportation. We had a four wheeled car that sat four people.", " What sports do you like to watch in the summer?", " My favorite sports to watch in summer are soccer and tennis.  I love it when the World Cup takes place in June and July.  But it is also nice to sit outside at a baseball game for the experience and ambiance.", " Some stations are still popular,  like the ones that have the announcers doing the sports.  ", " They're kinda funny. Not really my favorites. Are you a sports fan?", " I like baseball and hockey.  I do not watch it often though. Do you like sports?", " What sports interests you?  Did you know baseball managers can play in the game if needed?", " Follow sports? I didn't realize that in 39 of the 50 states, the highest paid state employee is either a college football or a basketball coach.", " I am not really into sports but that does impress me. I hope they are worth it.", " That seems a little crazy.  But that's sports for you.  Nothing I can do about it.  Seems like people with the most important jobs should be the highest paid...but oh well", " I guess they justify it because the sports programs bring in a ton of cash.  I don't know though.  I guess they could always try to sell the Eiffel Tower to pay for it", " Great location, I hear. When you've got basketball? Some other sport?", " Yeah. Do you know who invented the sport?", " Nice to meet you, Basketball is one of my favorite sports. Are you a Kansas Basketball fan? ", " I agree! It sets a great example for sports players who are role models to the younger community ", " I agree, its one of my favorite moves and it gives the sport a special flavor so it seems kind of dumb to ban it, its a good thing it isnt banned anymore", " Basketball is an exciting sport. There are many teams and players. ", " Me too.  If you look at the average salary per NBA players, NBA players actually get paid the best out of all professional sports.", " They do? I guess that makes it one of the most popular sports then, its curious how most players end up bankrupt or under financial stress after their careers are over", " Maybe, I wonder how much Japanese baseball cards are worth, baseball is so popular there they don't even think of it as an american sport", " Its a good idea to start in North American and then go south, I also heard the sport is popular in Japan, it has many fans.", " Yeah Bill Belichick is one of the best coaches, he must be worth a lot, so what other sports do you follow, maybe soccer?", " I Know it  is a very popular sport but I never got in to soccer", " It is, there are 250 milllion players as well and generates more money than most of the other sports combined", " He did indeed, most players get sweet endorcement deals from sports brands", " Yea, but it can be a confusing sport, like when a team can score an own goal and advance in a cup match", " I do, I  think its a fun sport its one of the national sports of Canada right?", " Yes it is! Canada is actually the only country with 2 national sports.", " The only one really? what it their other national sport do you know?", " Yea his sister was an awesome player, I guess they're a basketball/sports family Like Ogunbowale's family who has a brother who plays for the Buccaneers", " I think that would be kind of cool to see in any sport really. I could imagine the chaos of 33 players on the field at a time in soccer and football, it would be like a sport battle royal haha.", " That's true, football is very much an american sport, and soccer is player almost everywhere.", " Haha that's a good point! Why you think Canadians are so good at hockey though, their national sports are lacrosse and ice hockey, I get hockey is because maybe it's really cold in Canada but I wonder why lacrosse is a national sport", " that's true. but funny enough, Soccer actually brings in more cash than pretty much all others sports put together, including basketball and football. I could hardly believe it!", " hey my friend do you watch the sport hockey?", " ah ya he is a good guy, crazy that Canada has two national sports, hockey and also lacrosse, I only like hockey though", " Are you into any other sports? likw association football? AKA soccer?", " well I don't like it but it is impressive that it is a top sport in over 200 countries, what about you", " yup, that is a ton, and I guess it makes more than every othe sport combined, thats insane!", " I spent most of my life listening to the radio while working as a delivery man. Really loved listening to sports talk!", " They  really do...I always found in wonderful to just travel the miles I had to do everyday just entrenched with that sports talk on the radio...hated the same commercials over and over though.", " Yeah that is true.  Did you know that Canada is the only country to have two national sports?", " He was? That's pretty cool. I guess that soccer is the world's most popular sport so many more people play than I imagined.", " Yeah it sure is, it makes more money than all the major sports combined it sounds like. ", " I do, I used to play it when I was younger. I was a pitcher. Great sport. ", " I'm not a fan so much.I appreciate the game.But I just never gotten into sports so much.I did you still like to play the game I was a kid. It was really fun.", " Cool, It is very popular today, and it makes more money than many other sports combined!", " Yeah. Did you know that soccer makes more money than some other sports combined?", " A car is motor vehicle used for transportation now days.", " Just sports and news.  Though you can listen to thousands of classics for free on a website", " Nice, I prefer sports cars myself. I have a convertible mustang myself. ", " I don't really know much about the sport. I've never played it. How about you?", " no, seems like a rich persons sport to me. The average american golf course consumes around 312,000 gallons of water per day. That is a lot of water!", " Probably in hot climates, too, where water is scarce. Yep, it's a rich person's sport. I bet we could use that land for something productive.", " A blur of windmills and tulips. Life is good there. I wish the US had some kind of proper commuter transport.", " Isn't that the truth, seems like we're way behind on public transport!", " It doesn't feel like the US has public transport. If the the Norwegian government can donate $1bn to help save the amazon rainforest, can they donate to our public transport?", " Nope, however I would have totally bought it.  Transport home would be a problem though.  You know luggage weight requirements....", " I like to watch a lot of sports programs, so most of my DVR has basketball or european soccer on it lol.  How about you?", " Yes, Iceland is an odd case. No rail transport. Horses with five speeds. I am not surprised that they would use Facebook. I wonder if there will be hijinks and mischief though.", " nope! I still live out in the sticks. But I have netflix and the internet so I can watch all the horror I want! I hope your wife is understanding of your sports! I used to watch alot of vidoes and dvd's though.", " Hey how's it going. I think wrestling is a fascinating sport. It can be either theatrical or competitive.", " I can certainly see that - Greco Roman wrestling was probably developed for combat before it was sport for the emperors. ", " Yet sounds like it. The Turkish national sport is oil wrestling where men doubt themselves in olive oil and wrestle. Definitely an odd sport lol.", " Wow!  Again, due to my age and obvious immaturity, I think of something completely different when I hear oil wrestling than a Turkish national sport involving men! ", " Yes I would much prefer to be the women's national sport. The man who designed macho man's wrestling gear also design close for Jimi Hendrix, Aerosmith, and more.", " that is great. i think americans need the cup. it is a good country for big sporting events. lots of big stadiums. ", " I read a statistic that more kids play organized soccer now than any other sport in America, especially as the head injury thing becomes a bigger issue with football.  ", " More money is usually placed with male dominated sports.", " I guess they needed a coach and he was willing to live in Kansas. LOL. I think it's a great sport for young people. It has evolved so much since its inception.", " A play on the name All Blacks. I wonder how good they are. Rugby is the sport in NZ", " I think that Hungary had little more to do than practice.  They were under the thumb of the Soviet Union in those days.  Our US women do better than our men in this sport.", " Well yeah Im sure Britain and france are very competitive on many levels not just sports lol Jon stewart was a skilled soccer player in college and represented the us at the pan american maccabi games in brazil in 1983.", " Me either, It is a very lucrative sport and business still though", " THat is true, they make more than some other popular sports combined", " Do you like watching sports?", " The sport does drive money in.  More than Football, Basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and hockey!", " Well internationally, soccer is the most popular sport", " dang, I would never have thought that. Soccer makes more money than all other sports COMBINED", " Thats crazy that soccer makes more money than most american sports put together!", " The women are great! i wish that more americans followed the sport. the us women do a great job of representing the country.", " I've heard the argument that our best athletes don't play soccer. I don't know if that holds any weight though. It's crazy the US isn't bigger into the largest global sport.", " Well said. Perhaps follow a national team, too? As you said, sports can be a religion.", " i like it when the US does well in the world cup. it is not a popular sport here, but it is a good sport for young people.", " it really is the global sport. everyone except americans follow it closely. it is a great sport, but a bit slow, and there is not enough scoring.", " Americans would say that, but baseball can be a slow sport, too, don't you think?", " Too rich to sweat the small stuff and enjoy sports w/out international \"incidents\". Cheers!", " That is crazy,  doesn't seem like a typical olympic sport lol ", " Yeah, also architecture, music, painting and sculpture, I dont see them as sports either.", " I watch mostly live and recorded sports so I have cable.  Did you know there are over 750 episodes of a Pokemon show?", " I usually just listen to sports shows on am radio, nothing serious like Nunti Latini I'm not too well versed in classical latin", " No, not really, I only watched a little of the first season.  The only reality shows I watch are sports.  How about yourself?", " Yes, I enjoy listening to the radio, music and sports.  As far as Idol goes, did you watch the season Trent won?", " no, I'm not Canadian. So I didn't grow up with it being my national sport.", " I see well I love hockey and yeah it is more a Canadian sport than American, I also like lacrosse", " Yeah Canada has two national sports one is the previously mentioned hockey and the other is lacrosse", " That sounds like a physical demanding sport, 8 pounds in a game! I have to start playing hockey lol", " Yeah, we're the only country that refers to our sport as Hockey. Everyone else is talking about field hockey.", " lol. Maybe they like the tactics. Do you like any sports? Maybe hockey?", " I guess hockey is most exciting when it's on ice. Canada has TWO national sports. The other one is played on grass.", " Yep the other sport is lacrosse. Have you ever watched lacross before? It's pretty boring LOL", " Yeah if I am not wrong the NFL is one of the lowest paying professional sports. That is not to say 1.9 million dollars is not a ton of money but there are other sports that pay a lot more.", " Not really unless it is live sports an I can have it on in the back ground. You?", " Yeah I have seen the movies and I do worry about concussions, my son loves the sport and its hard to take that away from him", " I completely agree. Some players can perform at multiple sports. Russell Wilson is that talented.", " I mean pursing a degree while playing professional sports is also incredibly impressive", " haha-I bet they do! I know they all like to golf. The only sport that does not use a standardized playing area.", " I do not know.  But, she did like to play the sport of dwarf tossing.  She even had one thrashed for not wanting to be tossed!", " Wow that is amazing. Do you know who invented the sport?", " I do watch tv but mostly movies. I like documentary's lol about the moon if I can ever find one on. I sometimes watch baseball with friends or another sport but love movies the most. I have always liked That 70s Show.", " I see, I watched a few of high school and college games  I think its an exciting sport", " ya I think baseball is super boring to be honest, what about you? I'd rather watch any other sport", " Politics and sports also. The supreme court has a basketball court on the top floor.", " I do sometimes. I like watching sports, especially baseball. ", " I didn't know this: The NFL is recognized as an entertainment business rather than a sport, just like the wwe.  I wonder why? ", " Same! I like learning a lot about the history of cars and transportation. It's crazy that it's legal to equip flame throwers to your car in South Africa! I don't know if I could do that myself. ", " The league was found on 1946, as the BAA , then the league adopted the NBA in 1949, the players are earning higher revenue than other sports.", " Successful carriers in sports and entertainment is commonly associated with the celebrity status. The political leader is become celebrity if they are popular in News.", " yeah,  probably,  sports gets paid ridiculous amount of money lol ", " There's apparently some guy who became a pro race car driver after winning the video game Grand Tourismo. I wonder if other video games can be used as a stepping stone to traditional sports.", " I'm not a big fan either but I respect the sport. Did you know that granny style is the most effective way to score points on the line?", " ya I would feel weird if my sister were better than me at sports haha, ", " no I didn't know that, so they make more than football and baseball players? Do you like any of those sports I personally don't like any sports", " Yes they are such a family with talented kids for the sport", " That is good to know, I'll have to check it out sometime. Have you ever seen the Transporter movies?", " ...I like that that's practical in the sports world. I mean, at least players like Duncan have the sense to finish college first.", " I do like the NBA, one of my favorite teams are the Cavaliers do you follow the sport?", " I dont see the big deal in playing on Christmas day. I mean if you were playing a sport for a living and making a lot of money wouldnt you feel like every day was christmas.", " I am interested in the sport. Are you familiar with Reggie Miller?", " Do you watch much tv?  I watch a lot of sports myself. ", " Hey you like to travel? I personally love it. I would love to go to Iceland but was bummed out to hear about the absence of public transport.", " Of course! I really want to travel to Japan or Iceland but Iceland seems difficult if it doesn't have public transportation systems, I have to fly domestic flights in between major towns. Do you enjoy traveling?", " Do they travel via rental cars in Japan though? I'd imagine it'd be hard to get used to driving on the opposite side of the roads, they do have a great public transportation system, but it would be difficult for me since I travel with a lot of luggage, how about you? Light traveler or the opposite?", " I come overly prepared ha ha. You can travel by car but everyone I know used public transportation. The Dutch are currently creating a commuter bus that will travel 160MPH. ", " That's a good team. I cannot believe there are only 4 major sports in North America.", " Do you like any other sport ? The NFL has great athletes  like Tom Brady and Eli Manning.", " I prefer football over the other three major north american sports leagues.", " How do you like  the single elimination tournament instead of a best of 7 games that we see in other sports ? ", " Are you a sports fan? ", " I do like some sports. What about you? What sports do you like?", " I like various sports but I've always been an NFL fan. Do you follow football at all? ", " I figure there will be a new Eli Manning or something. A genius that has a knack for sports. ", " I want to say something like 30 teams? The NBA is actually one of four of the professional major sports leagues in the US and Canada.", " I'll wait for the development of transporters...Beam me up Scotty! Fast buses are an improvement, especially since airfare these days is slower than it used to be!", " That is crazy! It in inconvenient to transport that while traveling. ", " Yeah.  I watch a lot of live concert vids on there as well as sports, comedy, etc.  Wish youtube was around a long time ago.  lol", " Nope, I live in a city so i use public transportation. Crazy that there are 1.25 billion vehiclees", " No soaps for me... Have you watched the HBO sports comedy called \"Ballers\"?  It has \"The Rock\" in it.", " Oh, is that the one that is a sports comedy?", " That sounds really weird. I don't do fantasy sports or anything like that myself. I don't even read fantasy like the Lord of the Rings for instance haha, and apparently there's a college where you can get an actual degree in studying tolkien studies which I didn't know", " Ford really made the car for the people. the average person finally had a useful mode of transport that they could fix on their own.", " Yeah. In Japan seems to be an extremely important and well watched sport", " Did you know it can be hard to tell managers and players apart because they both wear uniforms unlike in any other sport", " Right. Hernandez is evidently a very bright man, having written about his sport as well as playing.", " Sure.  In Japan,  baseball is so popular that many fans dont know its an american sport lol ", " Yeah. Did you know in Japan baseball is a very popular sport?", " I wonder if they would ever consider adding a Japanese team since the sport is so big over there", " I saw that, I think t hat would be really fun if you're in to politics...it's kind of like a sport or strategy game for those people, I guess you could say!", " Maybe that's how they're getting it to go so fast. A couple of high intensity flame-throwers at the back and boom. Iceland could use a bus like this. They seem to lack effective public transport across the island.", " Thats a lot of money for tolls, and that bus sounds like a great way of transportation, fast and you can still admire the view", " I guess soccer isnt as big as a sport in the US as it is in England, I would recognize him for sure and ask for an autograph", " I can't rememeber that.  I do know that Ice Hockey and Lacrosse are both the national sports of Canada.  They are the only country with two", " yeah and this task is getting harder as the amount of information we have is small.  did we say that basketball courts are on top of ice hockey rinks in some dual sport stadiums?", " Not at all. I'm not much of a sports person. Do you?", " Yes that is true that is another national sport there as well", " I know that Canada has dominated the sport in the past. In 1924, the first Olympic winter games, Canada scored 132 goals and let in 3 in the entire ice hockey competition.", " Yeah I guess Canada has a great hockey team, thats like their official sport, with lacrosse.", " The only country with two national sports! Hockey is a tough sport! An average professional hockey player will lose up to 8 pounds in one game. I wonder if that's true for lacrosse.", " I wonder who that was. The space for the rink is used efficiently. An ice hockey rink stays under a basketball court when switching sports", " Did you know Canada is the only country in the world with two national sports? And one of them is hockey.", " Just watching some sports. How about yourself?", " gymnastics is a sport that i dont really know well. i see it sometimes during the olympics though.", " I do. I am not one of the 33% that make up the bandwidth but my son and daughter are. I am usually watching sports...", " Yeah there is so much money in sports it's kind of ridiculous. Do you know what they call basketball players in New Zealand? ", " Can't say that I do, I don't really watch sports, I do think its funny there is a basketball court at the top of the supreme court, and they call it the HIGHEST court in the land haha", " And you can't just start on season 2 or 3 or you miss all the information from the previous ones! I know how that is. It's hard to even keep up with sports on TV for me.", " Hello, do you like team sports?", " So much money! Don't you think that is part of the reason all those designer sports labels are so expensive?  Like Under Armour, etc...? ", " Wow, i did not know that.  It's interesting they both have a similar origin.  You know, personally, volleyball is one of the sports I enjoyed playing when I was younger.  Not too good at it though, always hit the ball too hard, sent it out of bounds. LOL", " Yeah, all my nieces and nephews play basketball as well as other sports.  I guess I'm the one that missed out on most of those genes.  Hehe.  ", " I didn't know that. I used that site almost every day! How often do you drive your car? Cars typically at 4 tires and can transport people", " That was new to me.  Why would they (the coaches) want to be state employees though.  I would think that they could make more money doing something else related to sports.", " No. I saw that interview on real sports and it was so goofy. It was almost flirting... Really weird.", " That is correct basically they are the college program  for sports and it also includes the basketball, Suprisingly the FBI revealed that there was corruption in the NCAA. Corrupt connections with the shoe companies, agents, and coaches!", " From personal knowledge I believe shes a politician, which does relate her to this.  NBA is an active member of USAB (USA basketball) which is also recognized by the FIBA (international basketball federation)  That is a huge amount! The nba is on the most four major sports and NBA players are the worlds best paid atheltes by average salary", " I love the game, two teams, five players each and a rectangular court, sounds simple but its a great and complex sport", " I am a fan but not a diehard fan, I love the sport, you know a player was traded for only $1 once, he then won 4 stanley cups", " I didnt know that either, he must have some good litereature pieces then, you know that literature was like an olympic sport before 1952", " It is! I wonder why they arent olympic events anymore, maybe because they were boring and not really sports", " I agree! I like hockey. It is Canadas national sport!", " Yes, they had to choose two sports in canada. one was not enough. hm.", " Well, I've also watched sports like basketball and baseball, but never was that interested. I did play soccer when I was young.", " Sometimes sports are too dramatic for me too. I read about Derek Jeter disrespecting Bryant Gumbel.", " That's interesting. Maybe the NBA should have a class for the players so that they can manage the money they earn at an early age through sports to last their lifetime!", " All this chatting about sports makes me want to go play something...not sure it it will be baseball or basketball...maybe just a nice hike in sporty clothes!", " I can't imagine the pro games without the dunk. It is iconic to the sport. I always like seeing them shoot free throws though. Those take some skills. ", " All in all, I think I would rather be in baseball.  That is my favorite sport.  ", " I am, I'm a big sports fan in general but I do like basketball. Long time Knicks fan here. How about yourself?", " No I didn't know that. So apparently you like you said, there are different types of hockey, what is interesting to me is that Canada has a national sport. One of them is hockey and the other is lacrosse, no one watches lacrosse though LOL", " It is kinda funny lacrosse is a national sport of Canada considering how cold it get there ", " Yep that's true, hockey is probably their national sport because it is so cold in Canada, I can believe too that a hockey player can lose up to eight pounds in one game, both from the physical activity and the cold", " Yea hockey is a very demanding sport physically but a loss of 8 pounds in a game is still a lot", " Do you follow sports at all? Are you a hockey fan?", " Yes, I love sports and follow hockey sometimes. ", " Oh, yeah. I love sports history. I did hear that the Captain Alex Ovechkin was quoted saying that he did not want to suck back to back this year. He didn't want to go down in history that way.", " I bet a lot of teams sell out. Small arena, but it has a dual purpose: An ice hockey ring remains under a basketball court when switching stadium sports", " I am a big fan of movies and music, but most of all sports, and you?", " I suppose its all that padding they have to wear.  Not not making the sport any more attractive to me, tooth loss and excessive sweat.", " yes, he wrote a book called Tuesday with Morrie. he is a sports writer.", " War games are neat, requiring the children to transport toy guns, ammunition and bombs in the form of water balloons sounds really cool.  I think it's really hard to describe the affects of the \"great wars\" of the past considering how many people were really affected world wide, and this seems effective.", " Yeah. I prefer rugby, but I don't follow sports much. Did you know there's a running back who never fumbled in his whole career?", " That's pretty neat. Did you know that Vans, North Face, Nautica, Jansport, TImberland, Lee Jeans and Wrangler are all owned by the same company?", " Man i feel you on that, I hate golf, has to be the most boring sport ever created. Do you like Linkin Park?", " I am not a sports fan but I understand why people find basketball exciting.", " Yes, even I who is not a sports fan know who Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is because he was suck s celebrity.", " I have hear of the inventor of basketball. I heard he was a Canadian which is slightly ironic because basketball is not our number one sport. What other form of entertainment do you like.", " Correct. They help offset the cost of the second tiered sports.", " Its been more than 70 years now! I though it was an older sport, out of the 30 teams do you have a favorite one?", " I'm not really a sports person, but I do know the names of the popular ones, like the LA Lakers and the Chicago Bulls, but because I'm a New Yorker I guess the New York Knicks is my default favorite team.", " Maybe but its better to have an education as a foundation especially if you're going into sports.  ", " Yes exactly. And the NBA players are the highest paid players of any sport in the world.", " I bet Iceland does love hockey. I know Canada sure does. They are the only country in the world with two national sports, lacrosse and hockey.", " Definitely taking a gamble. Do any sports betting?", " Not as much as I want. For me it's the money not the time. I get enough time, but with 2 young kids, they take most of the money for college, sports, day care, etc. I wish I could travel more. I am hoping 2020 will bring more. What about you, do you like to travel?", " Television is the biggest entertainment medium for news, ads, fun. which is famous for transporting the moving images.", " Well that's good and hopefully so! I wonder if Kim likes sports? Speaking of sports, are you a fan of basketball? I think it's crazy that the highest paid employees in 39 states are either college football or basketball coaches!", " I used to think New Zealand's \"tall blacks\" was racist but I think that's what they call all of their sporting teams.", " True, but you still have to recognize his accomplishment for making what is among the most popular sports today", " I agree, he sure was a genius to create a sport as popular as basketball, you know the coach is actually he highest paid employee", " Yeah viewing a sporting event would distract you from a bad date. As long as your team is winning!", " No, how do they treat them?  With respect, I'd hope.  Cheerleading is actually pretty tough, there's more injuries in it than any other sport.", " ya I don't follow sports, but I did see the superbowl, pretty boring, I guess games only have about 11 mins of actual gameply", " Ya that is true, it makes the nfl not sound as glamourous as it's made out to be, as well the brain injuries they get that can cause long term damage, It makes you think twice about wanting to be a sports star", " Mostly sports and documentaries when I can find a good one. How about you?", " Do you play any fantasy sports?", " I don't play any fantasy sports, but i do read a ton of fantasy books.", " Anyways, do you wish sometimes that we still could use horses for transportation ? It seems so fun.", " The NFL is technically classified as entertainment and not sports, just like the wwe is.", " Haha what? Whose classification is that? NFL is most definitely a sport and not fixed like the WWE.", " I guess the business classification.  I definitely think of it more sport, than entertainment.  But as the commercial aspect, ticket sales, jersey sales, I can see the entertainment claim.  But still, sport, I say!", " Yeah I guess it was a much more famous sport back then. Did you hear about that rule for New Orleans cheerleaders?", " Yes, that why world wide soccer makes more money than football, basketball and the rest of professional American sports combined. In a poor country they can afford goals and a ball, where football equipment for each player or golf equipment is prohibitively expensive.", " Well, i grew up in the Midwest so it was Football/Basketball/Baseball as soccer was looked on as something foreign in 1978. By the time my son was in high school and living on the east coast it was an accepted varsity sport. Speaking of golf, did you read where Kim Jong-Il according to North Korea press has only golfed one time in his life and had 11 holes-in-on on the 18 holes. I\"m sure that is totally true and a record that will never be broken.", " That puts an added dimension to a non-contact sport like golf, I'm surprised it not televised on Fox. Are you a football fan, my old landlord loved the Steeler's and he'd be delighted to know Ben Roethlisberger has the most wins at Cleveland Stadium even over Cleveland quarterbacks. The world would stop on Sunday for him to watch the Steelers from our condo in New Jersey. Are you a football fan have a team out there?", " Haha, yes, we might be crippled if we didn't have them. Speaking of low cost sports, I must be a luddite. Did you know the official name of the game I call ping pong is actually Table Tennis and ping pong is actually sells table tennis equipment. I've been calling it by the wrong name all these years.", " Very limited public transportation where I live. Did you know that while cars replaced carts and buggies, Western Europe took a long time to accept them.", " oh now I got you lol. Sometimes I also buy lottery tickets but not that much. People regularly lay down cash on things their spouses could reasonably argue are throwing it into the trash. manicures, sports tickets, car washes, smartphone upgrades lol", " I have no idea, but it's definitely gone down hill as sport. ", " Did you know that Canada has two national sports: lacrosse and ice hockey?", " I have only watched a handful of games.  But I like other sports like football, basketball, tennis.  You?", " Hi, do you like sports?", " Hey I do like some sports. One of my favorites is hockey, what about you?", " Do you like the sport of football though? I know you said you don't like hockey, but football is also a very physical sport", " I run swim team in a diverse town and the best thing that can happen is a successful minority in the sport. I want a diverse team and that would helps us.", " It was an improvement, but I wonder if it deserved an award. I guess sports networks operate by a different standard.", " I'm sure the guy who made it is happy. NFL is so much newer then other sports leagues. As recently as the 60s bowlers would make twice as much as football players.", " I don't have an account, I mostly watch sports, but I think it is a very useful product. ", " I listen to sports and political talk radio during my work day (headphones) to stay informed and keep my multi-tasking quest alive ", " I heard that somewhere.  I would make use of public transportation!", " It's got rubber tires.  Roads aren't meant to handle anything else.  In Iceland they have to fly to travel between major towns if they don't have a car.  There is NO public transportation.  Weird.  I like Iceland because of it's tradition of books and reading at Christmas.", " Maybe.  I wonder why they don't have motorized transport?  ", " I wonder what mode of transportation King Kalakau used when he traveled the world", " That was probably the best invention ever in terms of sports on TV. I cannot imagine the game without it. I actually used to think it was physically there on the field when I was younger", " When did it happen?  Couldn't he use a car instead for transporting the books?", " Weird, they consider the nfl entertainment rather than a sport.", " Probably! I know my wife seems to win a lot of tournaments and stuff like that. She knows nothing about sports and chooses winners based on names and team colors!", " No, I mean, beyond even sports!  They have fantasy draft for the National Spelling Bee.  I heard that I was like, \"Say whhhat?\"", " Do you prefer radio shows that talk about music, gossip, entertainment news or radio with strictly music or other radio shows that talk about sports, news, etc.?", " I don't know if it's funny or insulting to the team. I love that football is a family sport.", " Which is very interesting since they are the only one that is a not for profit franchise in American professional sports.", " hi there. how are you? do you like sports?", " Hello,  I do like sports.  Do you like golf?", " Do you enjoy sports?", " Hello - I do enjoy sports. What about you?", " While it doesn't feel like so in the US, it is on the international scale the most popular sport. In any case, thanks for chatting.", " Yeah I remember watching a bit on an old black and white at a friend's house when I was younger.  I watch a lot of sports now. ", " Yeah the New Zealand names for their sports teams are a bit weird.  I think their rugby team is nicknamed the 'all whites'. ", " Hello, how are you? Do you follow any sports?", " I like basketball yeah, not a big fan of golf but both are great sports.", " I know sand traps all too well.  I spend a lot of time there when I play.  lol.  Golf is also one of few sports that doesnt have a uniform, but does have a dress code.", " I do like cars. I love the convenience of using them for transportation. Do you like cars as well?", " Yes but his sister was always better than him in the sport", " Wow that is too bad. Did you know the NFL is entertainment rather than sport?", " Yes, Its is my favourite sports.", " He was considered as the Pacers greatest player all the time. He retired by 2006. Great loss to the NBA sports and fans.", " They have some creative aspects, like the game they play on brooms, Quidditch. Definitely less straightforward than real sports like baseball.", " I'm not sure if we're supposed to mention specifics like that, but I definitely don't have that fact. But if it's true, that's insane (and believable). There's some shady things going on in America... On another note, did you know the man considered to be \"the father of modern Olympics\" won only one gold medal for a poem he wrote about sports?", " It's shocking how many areas of the world still have old school transportation. I think in Mackinac Island, Michigan, they've banned motorized vehicles for over 100 years, can you imagine?", " Oh yeah, I think they may have. I was remembeing this funny rule the other day, if the opposing team receives three bases if a player catches a baseball in their hat. It is hard to keep up with the sport sometimes.", " I watch mostly sports either live or on my DVR so I have to have cable television.  Do you watch the Simpsons?", " I didnt, so not only a baseball hall of famer but also a famous golfer, I guess he had sports running through his veins", " wow i guess he was good at multiple sports.  I saw that Samuel l. Jackson puts a golfing clause in his film contracts that allows him the oppurtunity to play golf twice a week.", " Do you ever play golf?  It can be a fun, but very challenging sport.", " Yes that is very sad. Also sad is that Reggie Miller sister was probably better at basketball van him lol I would be sad if my sister were better than me at a physical sport", " If it's safe, it could be an upgrade to a transportation system that potentially uses too much fuel.", " I think the Japanese are really on the forefront of transportation.", " Yeah what a family with so much talent in it for the sport", " They should all get in their cars and go elsewhere where it's safe. Thank goodness for 20th century inventions of transportation!", " Very sad. Too bad he couldn't have gotten into sports as a distraction.", " Speaking of sports, did you know that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's dunk shot was banned from college basketball for over a decade.", " Yes, I am a concert goer.  I love to hear that live music being played in the big venues like the sports stadiums and amphitheaters.  Now, that's entertainment!", " Is the the players themselves that make more money or the sport in general? Because it is an sport played in over 200 countries", " It is definitely the biggest sport in the world. Personally, I like American football, but parents of young children prefer their children to learn soccer, since it is safer that American football.", " Not really bout i'm familiar with the sport.", " Yeah Japan has always been passionate about the sport.  I think a lot of young people growing up thinking they did invent it. ", " Yeah I am, I always think of that movie Mr. Baseball when I think of Japan and that sport. ", " Soccer-baseball? It really is like a combination of those two sports", " I also like wearing polo shirts, even though I have never played the sport", " Yes that is kind of neat, I read about football too, the US version.  There are so many sports called football one can get confused.", " I watch a ton of live sports. It's kind of a problem for me. You?", " I watch sports too, but my favorite show is pokemon. There are just so many episodes, I can watch it forever and not see the same episode again.", " Wow, a lot of people are cutting the cord.  I like sports too much to cancel my cable.  At least we have so many choices, unlike it ancient Rome where they bred chickens for entertainment.", " That is funny. I like Bill Nye. Did you know the NFL is recongized as an \"entertainment\" business rather that a sport.", " Of course with kids, we love watching movies, playing games and doing sports.  My kids just got an old Wii - I remember playing the old Nintendo games when I was a kid", " That wouldn't happen, today.  It would be considered unsportsman like conduct and Georgia would have had to bench their 1st, 2nd, and probably 3rd string players, and most likely let their cheerleaders play Cumberland! Lol", " i have never tried fantasy sports. how does it work? do you bet or something?", " I think maybe in all sports the owners took a lot of advantage of the players. I think the tables have turned today, don't you?", " I do, but rarely. We use public transportation a lot here. Did you know in South Africa it is legal to equip your car with a flame thrower? ", " Yes, walking is good. human powered transport. I would love to visit that island and unplug and relax.", " No, I don't really know much about the sport.", " Have they won any Olympic Medals? Are they still active in the sport?", " Especially for public transportation. ", " The NBA is one of the four major professional sports leagues in US and Canada.", " yes. Basketball is a team sports which have five members in each team.", " That should happen. There should be equality in every sport.", " Not really, you? I do know this..The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world.", " I try to go to a few each year.  I prefer them to be in sports stadiums but outside concerts are nice when the weather is nice.", " I don't, but I usually see them talked about by other news stations.Do they do news about sports like football, much?", " I do like football its one my favorite sports and its also one of the four major leagues in North America, a lot of history there", " Car is the motor vehicle used for transportation on roads and make more comfortable travelling.", " if you were transported to the 30's, would you listen to a ventriloquist on the radio? That is so baffling to me that that was a popular program", " No but I want to see that! Did you know that soccer makes more than all other sports of the world combined? That is really crazy to me.", " I bet the would be interesting to watch! Isn't it wild soccer makes more money than pretty much all the other major sports combined?", " True. Plus it's played by over 250 million players in well over 200 different countries and dependencies. It's easy to see it's the world's most popular sport!", " It's not one of my most favorite sports because I'm a little on the short side so I was never very good at it! How about you?", " I don't know how much ATT makes as a company but their execs may not make as much as basketball coaches at state schools. It's funny because I can still remember the fact that James Naismith invented basketball. It's one of those random facts I learned and never forgot! Couldn't tell you the name of any other people that started a sport!", " Inventing a sport sounds super hard! I hear the US Supreme court has basketball court that's called \"the highest court in the land.\" I'm not sure if it actually is or not, though.", " I am a dallas mavericks fan myself, have been since I was young. What a great sport though, even with little parity now", " I follow other sports a bit more closely, but Ill watch a few games here and there.", " There can be money in pro sports, but the vast majority of kids in school will never make it pro. They accept a very very small percentage of people into pro sports. The way it is now, if you are not born into the life by someone that is already famous in it, your likely hood of getting there is slim to none.", " Oh yeah pro sports are not going anywhere, as long as there are people that excel at certain things and people will watch them do it, there will be sports.", " Yeah, at least in pro sports people have talent. I can't watch these reality tv shows like the Kardashians, there's no talent involved in that. Even Judge Judy is pushing it for me, she's a real judge but she's all show now. And still she's the second-highest paid celebrity only after LeBron James...", " hey did you know that the only presidents to sport beards have been republicans?", " Indeed. Aside for using facebook, do you enjoy any sports?", " Oh yeah for sure. I bet Netflix would be a lot more popular if they also showed some sports.", " Football hadn't developed as much of a sport then. I've heard that many of the world's biggest stadiums belong to college football teams. Not surprised. In some towns, there's not much else to do on a Saturday.", " He sure does. He would be a good ambassador for sport. Anyway, great chat!", " I guess I can see that as back then it was not a popular sport as it is now", " yeah it is but the NFL really ruins it for me. its wild to think how much watching sports has changed because of computers and the ability to do things with remote controls. ", " So unsportsmanlike. I wonder if painting the visiting locker room at the University of Iowa has ever paid off for that school?", " I like to watch football,especially the playoffs. Yes, I guess the name \"football\" is used for many sports around the world. How about you?", " She's making such unique clothing that I've heard she's actually got evening gowns made from sports jerseys.", " What if I hadn't asked that question? What if you weren't such a great sport? What if I wasn't ending this text session?", " Yup it sure does. In Iceland there is no rail so people have to figure other ways of transport", " Why would amazon know?  Also,  another weird fact,  Iceland has no public rail transportation,  most natives that dont have cars just fly domestic. ", " I don't watch it, but I know a little about it.  They say that the highest paid state employee is either college football or basketball coach.  I guess that lets you know just how POPULAR the sport is!", " Are you a big fan of sports at all?", " This is what sports were built off of in the 80s the drama so I don't know why they make it such a big deal", " I would like to see more people involved with soccer. I think it's a sport that playable by many people, unlike basketball and football.", " I agree it does, soccer makes more money than all the other sports combined, or at least the main sports played in America.", " Soccer is a sport that can be played by anyone anywhere. Very little special equipment. I wonder how the variation with three teams playing at once works. Who's the winner?", " Football is the team sports it is called by different name in different place. But the same rule is used in every place.", " It is, but here in the US they also call another sport football, which I think is pretty dumb. ", " Soccer makes more money than all other sports. So mainly dream to have place in team.", " It is played by 250 million players in different countries. Most popular sport around the world.", " Yes it is, do you know why Americans call the sport soccer?", " I need that that here. Have you heard about people fantasy drafting the national spelling bee? That whole fantasy sports thing is so odd to me.", " I don't, but I know it's really popular. There are so many differenr fantasy \"sports\"", " Wow! I didn't know that! It doesn't surprise me considering engineers have an impact on sports. NFL players have chips in their shoulder pads that record their every move during a game!", " Good Morning!  I do enjoy a good football game, but baseball is my favorite sport.", " Yes. I watch a lot of sports on it as well as entrepreneur videos and business inspirational/motivational videos.  I wish I would have created it.  It was started on Feb. 2005 ", " Good morning! How are you today? I'm just hanging out for the day. Do you like sports?", " Hi, I'm fine. I'm a girl so I like sports up to a point but don't play them personally.  I have heard a lot about football and the NFL lately.  I did know that the NFL has no written rule against female players.", " I love soccer. Only sport I really watch anymore. During the 1992 World Series, the Marine Corps color guard carries the Canadian flag into the stadium upside down. Ouch. ", " Yes, i getcha. But many americans do not like the sport. it is a slow game.", " I guess they want their celebs to be political pure. it just doesnt happen. people of many beliefs play sports. ", " im sure its due to the tv ratings going up in other sports over time. ", " the monetary value maybe, but after the education is paid, the staff, training, and everything for the athletes, i bet its not that much. sport programs arent free to have", " sure they would, through other avenues like they did before the sports boom. well man im out of here. thanks for the talk though", " Cool, do you watch alot of sports?", " I don't see why not, people have won awards for much less impressive deeds.  It's become so associated with the sport while watching on tv, I would say it was deserved.", " Bowling, the sport where drinking and nachos are encouraged.  Did you know John Stewart, the late night TV host played soccer in college?", " So, association football is another name for soccer?  Right. Hockey is another sport where the meaning changes based on location.  Most of the world thinks field hockey.  More running back and forth on a pitch.", " Oh, got it. I've been to something like that a few times. Have you even been to an outdoor amphitheater? I've seen some in photos, and a sports stadium in Greece.", " truly is the worlds most popular sport", " In Canada kickball is also called soccer-baseball , thats a weird name for a sport", " That is weird and this one is kind of interesting too.I have heard that Baseball is a really popular sport in Japan", " I know right, its a game with a lot of history and kind of new in comparison to other sports like football or soccer", " I like the Cavs just because that is where I'm from.  However, I follow everyone close because I'm a fan.  Same for baseball and football.  I just love those 3 sports.", " me too. so much drama and craziness like a greek Drama. All the action in sports is basically a 4 part play", " That is a wild fact. I can see it being true though because sports is what make colleges famous and popular. I know basketball is so popular that even the Supreme Court Justices play. ", " Yeah, I love betting on fanduel. When I am not watching sports I am watching dramas on tv. How about you? Do you have any favorite actors?", " I dont really have a favorite team anymore. I jut like to watch it sometimes. I think the NBA has the best athletes of any sport in the world.", " I understand they've the best paid of any pro sport, too. I follow the Wizards, who play in a region where I can get games. They're had some dramatic games lately. Seen any?", " Agreed. Not sure yet if my team, the Wizards, can go all the way this year. DC teams have surprised a lot of folks in other sports recently, like hockey.", " Hi! Are you a fan of college sports? I remember from that movie, Rudy, that Villanova University has a really intense football team and culture surrounding it.", " Yeah, that's a lot of expensive sports cars.  Some people are in it for the money, others the girls. Michael Caine got into acting at school because all the cute girls were taking drama.", " The National Basketball League was adopted on August 3, 1949, so this made a profit for every team. I bet half the team players did not know about YMCA. They only care about the fun of the sport and money.", " I guess it is an expensive sport to watch and they make a lot of money off of it", " Hi, how are you? Are you interested in sports?", " I like sports. Don't have much time to watch them. Usually I pay attention around the playoffs.", " hi, how are you? do you like sports?", " Good afternoon, I know a little about some sports, any in particular?", " um, what about basketball? that is an interesting sport.", " yeah, the fair weather fans. they get some pride by associating with a winning team. i like sports because it is fun to watch. my identity is not tied up in the team.", " Football is a great sport, and it has come a long way! You know, in the 1960s, the top pro bowlers made twice what the best football player made? How things have changed!", " That is strange, maybe football wasnt a popular sport back then I don't see bowlers making much these days.", " I feel the same way, I think resources are being taken advantage of badly. I feel that those that play golf are not really caring of what it takes from other things to have nice green grass to put on. they just see the sport of it.", " I can't say that I am I don't watch sports, but I am watching the superbowl right now, what about you?", " Same! Soccer is definitely interesting though, it actually makes more money than all the other major sports combined.", " hi. i love watching sports on tv , my absolute favorite to watch is the World Cup", " I have always wondered why football would ever be called soccer though, because to me soccer is a totally different sport however i have learned that soccer is is also called association football and i was really surprised when i found out soccer makes more money than football ", " Me neither unless they were trying to confuse the other team. lol.  i find so many things interesting about football and sports in general. Did you know that the university of iowa locker room for visiting football teams is painted completely PINK... that must be funny to see ", " Yes there is a lot of craziness in sports.  But it gets you in shape for sure!  Soccer players run around 7 miles during a game - but probably not the goalie", " I think it's great that woman are getting a chance to show they can be sports announcers.", " Absolutely, and I'm excited to see it happening in soccer, since I used to play and I'm a fan of the sport.", " I'm not very familiar with it.  It's interesting that it is a more popular sport than all the other sports.", " It's probably because it's a worldwide sport thanks to FIFA, whereas other sports are more local to one country/region, like American football in the US, or baseball.", " There aren't many sports that have a World Cup to the same level that soccer does, which is one great part about making announcing open to everyone instead of just men; it opens the door to equality worldwide.", " Another interesting fact about soccer is it's also called football.  Apparently the term football is used in many countries for different sports.", " It's a very generic name if you think about it - \"foot\" and \"ball\" - so it makes sense that name would be applied to a lot of sports.", " Maybe I will watch it as well.  I'm very inspired about the sport after our conversation.", " The sport and the announcers!", " I love the game. It's my favorite sport I'm so exited about the WC we are hosting in 2026.", " I guess its because the Superbowl is more like a local event, soccer does move more money than the rest of the sports combined", " I am shoced to hear it is the worlds most popular sport, i thought it might be cricked", " I don't know anything about cricket!  I grew up in Okinawa and once met a Brazilian soccer team there.  And I dated a guy who grew up in Italy and was very fond of soccer.  I guess I knew it was the worlds most popular sport.  However, I did not know that it grossed more money than any other sport combined.  Did you know that?!?", " I did not, that is surprising because more affluent countries love other sports, but europe loves soccer, so I guess that makes sense", " Yes, but football requires a lot of protection - helmets, badding, etc.  Soccer is probably the most accessible sport there is.  Tennis might be right behind it - a racket and a ball :)", " I don't actually but I don't like many sports. Yeah, I guess we are the only weird country. Soccer makes more money than most all other major sports combined", " Good point! Many sports figures give back to good causes nowadays, like Mesut Ozil donating his 300,000eur bonus to pay for surgeries for brazilian kids.", " That is really cool. Speaking of awesome sports players, I heard that BEnjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the ball in his NFL career.", " I mostly meant American football! Although it's interesting how many sports share the name. Did you find the facts on football interesting?", " Yeah, so crazy!! I don't really follow soccer but i think that i should start considering it has 250 million players in so many countries and is the world;s most popular sport! may be time to get into it!", " It's truly amazing! Although it certainly helps that soccer makes more money than a lot of other major sports combined!", " Oh that must have felt amazing for him! The U.S. frequently dominates in many sports, I wonder if they felt the same level of emotion to receive third place in 1990!", " Absolutely, ESPN certainly helps sports maintain their hype here. It was lovely talking to you!", " It makes more than every other sport combined. ", " I think so to. the endurance you have to have is off the charts. i like soccer as well very respected sport. ", " I had no idea he played or that he was that skilled at the game.  I think it is very admirable that the German player Mesut Ozil paid for surgeries for 23 children in Brazil.  More sports stars should be like that instead of wasting money on harmful things like drugs or drinking too much.", " I am not very knowledgeable about sports, but I learned a lot from reading this.  I had no idea you could play soccer with three teams at the same time, I would like to see that.  Have you ever seen a three team soccer game? ", " No I don't watch soccer. Or \"football\" hehe For whatever reason I'm not that big into so many sports! I've played soccer, it was fun enough. Do you watch soccer? Or have you played?", " I guess Americans call it soccer because it was slang for \"Associated Football\". Interesting! Kind of complicates things for me, since we also have a sport called football.", " That was an American football game between Georgia Tech and Cumberland. It was a blowout. Probably the worst defeat in sports. ", " I would imagine because soccer is such a popular sport. it's played in over 200 countries by 250 million people.", " Yeah, it's so popular that it makes more money than all of the other major sports combined!", " I'm not surprised soccer makes more than football and the other sports combined, it is the most popular sport in the world for a reason", " Soccer is my favorite sport!! do you like it?", " Its a really popular game in fact it makes more money than almost every other sport combined", " Unfortunately, I know very little about the sport. I just learned that Americans call it soccer because it was slang for association.", " Thanks for chatting. I learned a lot of new, fun information about sports.", " Too bad the US didnt make it, its the first in many years, soccer is a sport that makes a lot of money, more than the most popular combined.", " Hello, are you a fan of sports?", " I'm not but I do know that it makes more money than all other world sports combined", " It's high on the priority list since the World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world.", " personally I don't haha, I don' watch sports but I guess the world cup will be in 2022 in Qatar, what about you?", " that is impressive! also, can you believe that soccer makes more than any other sport in the world, even when theyre all combined?!", " I think that's because it's such a worldwide sport. It is the world's most popular sport, after all", " it can be fun to watch and is the most popular sport", " true, and what about the british saying sports destroys happiness?", " that is why the british say sports destroys happiness?", " My guess is not. I figure the funding is too low. American Football is too big for soccer to take over. Do you play the sport yourself?", " No, I don't play any sports. What about you? The American women's soccer team is good. They have never placed below third place in the world cup since 1991.", " That would be cool. Maybe it would get Americans more into soccer. Soccer makes more money than all other major sports combined.", " exactly! Soccer may make way more money than all other sports combined, but it just isnt as popular here in the US", " I guess all American's would share your attitude, as do I. I wouldn't say it's not as popular though. Association Football (as it's sometimes called) is way different than the sport us Americans know as football", " I think association football is just another name for soccer, so we would be exactly like soccer which is a sport that is played by about 250 million people all over the world", " No I don't like to watch that I think it's really boring, in fact it is shocking to me that it makes more money than all other sports in the world combined", " True, I went to a game in person though once, it was a game of AC Milan versus Real Madrid, it was like the Super Bowl even though it was a regular game, people love soccer. What sports do you like ?", " Well I don't really like any sports LOL but I will watch football from time to time. Did you hear about the German soccer player mezzet Ozil by the way?", " Nice.  Soccer is so popular that it makes more money than all of the other major sports combined.  Surprising.  ", " Hey there, I sure do. It is a sport that makes tons of money more than some other combined", " Wow must have been a popular sport back then. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?", " hi how are you? do you like sports?", " Nope, apparently it is a British word.  Part of it is Americans do not want to relinquish the football as it is an American sport.", " I bet not as much as soccer, as soccer makes more money than football, basketball and like other 3 more sports combined.", " Oh wow, probably because it is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries, seems like a slightly less dangerous sport than football", " NFC! I really love the Dallas Cowboys since I grew up there but since moving to the north, I feel a bit awkward to sport a NFC team haha, you?", " Are you involved in sports betting?", " No, I have never placed a bet on a sporting event, what about you?", " Are you kidding me? I love soccer, its the greatest sport ever lol, its played in over 200 countries and the World Cup is really exciting", " Yeah I get it. It's also makes more money than every other sport put together LOL. I just think it's so boring to watch, and the scores are so low. Did you know there is a soccer variation where three teams play, maybe that's the one for me LOL", " Haha well I don't really like any sports, but I do think that American football is more interesting than soccer, that's just my opinion though, I did like the Patriots winning this year at the Superbowl and I like that they have a player who's never fumbled the ball, have you watched the Super Bowl?", " A waste. A shame really. I wish that sports didn't suck up so much cash. The United States got 3rd place in the first FIFA world cup in 1930. I'm amazed. I guess the US has moved away from soccer since.", " True.  Soccer is the world's most popular sport though.", " I guess it was not that popular of a sport back in the day", " Yeah. And it is a sport that brings in a lot of money for those involved in it", " Yes they make more than other sports like hockey, basketball and baseball combined", " Yeah probably LOL. I also like soccer. And soccer makes the most money out of many other sports combined!", " it sure does. the world loves soccer. played by men and women. young and old. the democratic sport.", " he looks like he could soccer. he has the build for it. it is a good sport for people that are not tall or muscular.", " the world cup is huge, probably bigger that the viewership of all us sports combined. i bet a billion people watch.", " Yeah probably haha.  Did you know soccer makes more money than all the sports combined.", " When we think of football we think of the American sport. The rest of the world sees football as soccer.", " I don't know any. We have quite the good local teams though. It seems to be becoming a popular sport in many high schools. We never had a soccer team when I was in school. ", " A few. I do know that the current holder of the Cup is France. I find it fascinating that France won. I don't really think of them when it comes to sports. ", " I think the US gets hyper focused on sports that really only have importance here like american football. It is so overwhelming in popularity that it leaves other sports not getting as much play which means the US doesn't do as well. ", " I watch it sometimes. I know the sport makes more money than some others combined", " Do you have a favorite sport to watch on there, or do you watch it more for their TV personalities?", " It's still an interesting move on their part. Maybe they're trying to get more women interested in their sports coverage.", " That's a good way to put it! Having women who are part of the sport might help reduce anyone's skepticism about their aptitude for the sport announcing job.", " I wonder if they'll move on to bigger sports announcing jobs. Maybe they could cover a FIFA tournament someday.", " Do you like soccer? its one of my favorite sports", " Its a nice sport right, I can believe its played by more than 250 million players, that is a big number, speaks of the popularity of the game", " Yea, he is very charitable.  It is good for the sport", " Oh I see I bet he is a  big fan of the sport, strange how the World Cup doesnt bring economic gains to the hosting countries, it promotes a lot of tourism so thats weird", " What do you think about sports?", " I like sports a lot, I like all sports, but my favorite is Pro football and basketball.", " How much do you agree with the thought that people follow sports because they're not good at predicting their team's success?", " Makes sense. No wonder soccer players get paid more than all other sports combined.", " Geez. Some people take sports a little too seriously", " Yes you are right, what is your favorite sport if you have a favorite sport?", " Basketball or baseball. Whatever sport is on is my favorite.", " Yeah, it is a great game for getting in shape. lots of movement. plus it is popular all over the world. far more popular than other sports.", " Nope. Can't imagine it. And I have a pretty good imagination. Although, I see Junior is now sporting a beard.

Yes, I often listen to sports talk in the car.  Do you listen to the radio often?", " Yeah, I hear so much about Tom Brady! I'm into football, somewhat. I find the sport interesting for weird reasons such as TBI research.", " That makes some sense, I'm sure his hand-eye coordination was amazing! If only it were that easy for other sports... ", " I have never followed sports much, though I heard that the basketball game schedule for 2018 and 2019 came out.", " Lebron does all kinds of stuff. Not only is he a NBA player he is an Olympian, a person who raises charity funds and makes tons of money as a sportswear spokesperson. ", " Hard to say. But I doubt we'd be using automobiles for personal or freight transportation on anything like their present scale if it hadn't been for massive subsidies to the Interstates and civil aviation, and to car-centered urban development.", " I guess the Japanese love the sport and have made it their own. I figure that some of the better players from Japan can find a home in the MLB>", " I love the sport. Who's your home team? I'm a Braves fan at heart. haha", " That is surprising. I also found out Soccer makes more money that football, baseball, basketball...and a few other sports combined.", " I guess soccer is the largest sport in the world. It has players in over 200 countries. Can't say that about football.", " Well take care sports fan!", " Soccer makes more money than most sports combined! That is insane? Is it because it's worldwide?", " It actually doesn't surprise me.  Some sports fans can take things way too far.  ", " Do you think such things happen in less popular sports too?  The threats and all?", " I did hear something about that, apparently involving social media threats even. I wonder what they are considering a threat here. I know people take their sports very seriously, but \"come on!'", " Maybe, or maybe other sports have paid a lot higher since 1968 so more black people choose that instead of tennis", " I imagined they did as they had a lot of money and tennis is a popular sport among politicians, also golf.", " Hi, how are you? No, I don't really understand the sport well. How about you?", " Until 1978 a tennis player was allowed to use absolutely any object as a racket. I wonder if that's the case with table tennis. I would expect size and shape to be regulated in all paddle/racket sports.", " What is your favorite sport?", " My favorite sport is baseball. ", " Hi, yes I am a lot into sports, I like football, ", " Yeah I still do as well, but mostly sports programs now.  Did you ever watch the Simpsons?", " Sometimes.  I like watching \"The Voice\", the news, and some sports.  I also watch a lot of streaming tv.  What about you?", " I like sports and animated series. I like South park and Family guy the most", " I remember that very well.  That was not good for the team and the sport in general. ", " No, it was slimy.  Football is a BIG business with a lot of money at stake.  They forsake sportsmanship for money.", " What is your favourite sports ?", " I love ice hockey. I think football is the most popular sport in the US but I'm not sure.", " I like those old-timey leather helmets they wore. What's your favorite sport?", " Yes he is a NBA hall of famer but his sister was always better than him in the sport", " No especially in college. I don't really like sports at all, but if I had to watch sports it would be in college sports, what about you.", " Haha. Who is your favorite sport? Mine is Basketball.", " Yeah I do like the sport, do you like hockey?", " Woah, that seems like a really physically demanding sport, I need to start playing hockey and lose some weight lol", " Did you know that up in Canada they have two national sports - hockey and lacrosse.", " I also like lacrosse, dont follow the game much but its interesting, and wow I bet Canada is the only country with two national sports", " Yes.  They are the only country in the world to have two national sports.", " Oh I see, well I think its interesting how ice hockey rings have two purposes and used for two sports", " What is the other sport they are used for?", " That's cool I did not know that. Canada is the only country in the world with two national sports, lacrosse and hockey.", " What drastic and opposing climates for those two sports. The US doesn't have more than one national sport? Basketball and football seem to be super popular.", " Yea I think that's our sports and probably baseball too. ", " Sometime only i watched it. I watch only sports channel and discovery channel. It is the best for entertainment in home. Sometime serials.", " Howdy! A sports fan at all?", " Bummer for them. Every follow Japanese baseball. The sport is huge there apparently.", " Hello. Do you watch much sports?", " Yeah but it still was a dangerous sport.  ", " It really is. There are a lot of injuries. I think probably across football in all its forms it makes up the most sports injuries of any other sport. ", " Yeah a crazy contact sport. ", " Right!? I wonder if now they watch the world series like we watch their baseball games. It would make sense since they love the sport that much. ", " I have but not very much. It seems like a fascinating sport. Do you know much about it?", " That's too bad. It seems like sadly baseball is a dying sport in america. I think more people are getting interested in soccer or football. ", " I watch a little tv but I always have live sports on in the back ground. Not sure why.", " My friend had one and it was so uncomfortable watching it with glasses on. I think if they did sports in 3d, that would have been better.", " I don't watch sports, I like arts, but I don't like dance, do you like to see a dance performance ?", " Cha-cha, martial arts...what couldn't that man do?  But I guess a lot of other sports have dance-like qualities, so it makes sense that he might excel in dance.    ", " Funny.  It just means he didn't make it as a \"Hollywood President\"  Maybe in his role as the Gipper is why the NFL is considered \"entertainment\" and not sports", " Hello there, are you a sports fan at all?", " Do you like watching sports?", " I love watching sports. I am doing it now. do you like watching sports?", " Yes, that is the one. I'm going to go watch some sports right now. Catch you later!", " Baseball is a good game, but a bit slow. Do you like other sports?", " Yeah it is a bit slower than other sports, I really like basketball and soccer but mostly european soccer or football.  How about you?", " True. Bowling would be the sports of kings. And we would live like kings, kings of the alley, prince of the pins.", " Yeah, I'd watch just to see them do the strange looking shots! I wonder why people aren't more into women's sports. Reggie Miller's sister constantly outperformed him when he was in high school", " That is really interesting. Yea, it seems like men's sports are more popular. It would be fascinating to watch Reggie Miller's sister play, or the two of them play each other!", " I'm not sure we might need to look that up, The NBA is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada", " yet he invented the sport. go figure", " ya I don't know about that that seems like an annoyance, also annoying would be transporting rabbits like they used to do on old ships, they would release them so there was food for future explorers on the islands haha", " That's interesting. My favorite sport is actually baseball and I'm an Astros fan. I'd also like to see Pete Rose inducted into the hall of fame ha-ha. I'd like to see baseball players and baseballs with tracking chips similar to what the NFL uses for their players to record movements of the players and the ball. ", " Yeah, that is my favorite sport to watch so I'll have a good half a year off from watching.  I bet the players will be happy for the time off, and visit many restaurants.  Even though cheerleaders and players can't be at the same restaurant at the same time.", " Yes, it does seem like sports can be a driver for international cooperation and respect.  ", " Crazy, isn't it?  There's a player with a lifetime contract paying over 3/4 of a million a year until he's 55.  He gets a 30+ million dollar final payment at that point.  Those salaries just don't seem commensurate with the value that they hold for the individual sports fan, though.  How much of our own personal identity do the majority of us associate with \"fan of <insert sport team here>\"?", " It's almost as though sports are no longer about the athleticism, but about marketing and appearances.  There's been proven research that shows a style of shooting that garners the most points for the player, but because the players think it makes them look ridiculous, they don't do it!  Obviously, the play itself is no longer the priority.  So, if that's the highest value for the players and their sponsors, what are the fans actually getting out of it?", " It's interesting, actually, that we started with the concept of honor and respect in politics, but now we're seeing that same sentiment/value in sports as well.  It's become so pervasive that even the highest paid athletes don't respect and honor their sport and their fans to play to the best of their ability.  We're losing our integrity.", " A cool three million dollars! I bet the guy couldn't believe his luck. Baseball is popular in Japan, too, so popular that many of those people don't even realize that the sports started in the US. Can youse believe it?", " It probably would help. Most presidents are sports enthusiasts right?", " I do, I watch a lot of live sports on tv.  I would say that is why I still have cable to be honest. ", " Nice!  I didn't know that about Murphy, Arizona is such an awesome place I want to go back soon!  And yeah Aguilar is such a good guy too, I love sports pros who you know are decent people in real life.  Did you know managers can technically play if needed?!", " Pretty sure I remember him pinch hitting, could be misremembering.  He's an ongoing black eye on the sport for sure, should be in theHOF, but the steroid era was pretty bad too and continues to have HOF fall out", " For sure!  Pretty sure Sean McVey (Rams Coach) is younger than the majority of sports fans that will be watching the Super Bowl.  The youth in the front offices are changing the game, hot stove league is a joke now.  But I think without the youth taking over, the sport (most sports) would devolve and fade away", " I am a fan but I think they take the sport a lot more serious over there lol", " That's a good question. I'd rather just stick to fantasy sport drafts and such - like football. I'd love to fantasy draft a player like Benjarvus Green-Ellis who's never fumbled the football in his entire pro career. That takes serious talent and skill!", " Yes but i have heard that international players have had hiccups learning the sport.", " It was a more popular sport back then so I can see how that worked", " Wow I guess it makes sense since it is such a big sport here. ", " Maybe the other team never played football against a real team, the sport was somewhat new at the time. I would feel bad about the game even if i was on the winning team.

You?", " the US is amazing in that way. the stadiums are like holy temples consecrated to the sport of football. we worship there.", " ESPN is the sports network yes? they cannot win an award for drama or comedy i think.", " Liverpool F.C. is my favourite. You can play other sports ?", " I do like listening to audio books when the author narrates.  I don't follow too much basketball, but I do know that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's use of the dunk got the shot banned from the sport in college for over a decade.

I mean its has become such a sport that espn won an emmy for the superimposed yellow line representing first down which really helped a lot of viewers better digest what was going on in football", " Indeed. I hope James Naismith was recognized well for creating what is arguably the among the most popular sport today.", " Television is still essential for broadcasting news and sports.", " Hockey is a great sport, I bet you lose a lot of weight playing it", " It would have to be, right?  I didn't know lacrosse was one of Canada's national sports", " Lacrosse is a fun sport. I used to play it in high school.", " I can't say that I do, I don't watch much TV or follow sports, do you?", " Yeah. Canada is also the only country with two national sports, you know which ones?", " It is the only country to have two national sports.

But in some countries they are playing only ice hockey.", " Canada is the only country in the world which has two national sports.", " I have never played hockey even though it snows a lot! Is hockey quite as big as it is in Canada where it's their national sport?", " That's one stereotype I bet they don't mind reinforcing! Especially since it's one of their national sports.", " Wow! That has to sting when you invented the sport. ", " Do you like playing hockey? I occasionally watch hockey because my brother likes the sport, but I don't have any interest in playing.

You?", " Yes, need more feet for sure except for transportation of good as our economy depends on cars for that.", " It's funny, but it's a lot of hard work, too.  I have to give him a lot of respect.  Ballet isn't an easy sport at all.  Dancers work so hard they go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week!

I liked going to baseball games as a kid.", " Watching games can become a fun event. I think it is unlikely that their will be a female NFL player.

I'm guessing that's the whole world.", " I know it is popular, but I always thought that the professionals in all sports here in America were paid so much more.  I guess I'm out of touch.", " I bet they do.  Seems like they are always telling us we Americans don't get it when it comes to soccer.

In Iceland to go between cities you usually have to take domestic flights since they don't have public transportation.", " I don't.

Football is a team sport and you need everyone firing on all cylinders.", " That's a concern in all sports. I follow the Blue Jackets, and the current coach raised these issues because he wants players to block shots! Of course the play style can cause injury.

Basketball is far from my sport.", " Yes, and it's not just talent. People have to work hard for their achievements in sports. They deserve to be paid and recognized for that time and effort.

It is funny how football means different things to different people throughout the world.", " True! I think a part of it is frequently these players come from low SES backgrounds, and they think being an athlete is a way for them to climb up the financial ladder. So they dedicate so much of their lives to a sport, pick a college major that will provide them the flexibility to practice, go to games, etc., and then they get stuck when they don't get drafted. Super tragic.  ", " Though that is true, I think it's kind of interesting how much money is generated from the players. Especially if you consider sports apparel (e.g., t-shirts, jerseys, etc.). I think they should be compensated for some of that. ", " Speaking of women in sports, do you follow tennis or Serena Williams?", " Who knows maybe they do, so do you like other sports maybe tennis?

It is not the safest sport out there,", " I really don't know. Since he's a quarterback, maybe he was also a pitcher. One good arm for both sports!", " They've sold out every game since 1960. I guess there's not much to do around there. No other sports teams.", " Well yeah we do, we don't actually need women NFL players, but it would be cool and it would be inspiring to tons of young female sports players.  And yeah, that is odd and stupid if you ask me. ", " It's a competitive sport. There is no rule against women in the sport. I wonder when they will show up.", " yeah...even giselle can't save him.  but at least hes not sporting a cowboy hat and bolo tie", " It is just a sport where so much goes into those 11 minutes from planning to split reactions. I", " Oh okay.  Do you know that Green Bay Packers are the only not for profit major franchise in American professional sports?", " I think that green bay packers are here to stay as depicted by George Martin. If there is every a end of real sports due to simulations, the green bay packers would be the last to go", " Yeah that would be a lot of fun to see. The Green Bay Packers are the only community owned not-for-profit major franchise in American professional sports.", " Right i like sports but that's way to much money. The highest paid across all us departments of defense employee's are three football coaches of service branches. ", " I think he might still be playing.  I had no idea it weighed and cost that much.  That's interesting!  Here's something a little different but sports related...Abe Lincoln is enshrined in the wrestling hall of fame, having lost only once in 300 matches.  I have never heard that before.", " Wow, that is some exotic designing.  his sport could theatrical or genuine!! either way i am not a fan!", " Ha! Funny to think of what a switch in careers that was! The Turkish national sport is men covering themselves in olive oil and wrestling. I  just can't picture that. It's a little gross!", " I thought those were two sports. Caps = Hockey, right?", " That's what I thought too. But I just don't know LOL. I don't really watch too many sports, I do know that Tampa Bay had some problems in game 1 of the Eastern Conference though", " I don't follow sports much myself, unless it's the playoffs. Then things get energized. What about this: The University of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink. Is this going to work? I doubt it.", " Yeah, I guess there are a lot of people who enjoy the parties that come along with the sport. There was a fun game where Georgia tech beat cumberland 222-0.", " It's surprising how much the sport has evolved since then. ESPN won an emmy for the superimposed yellow line they created.", " Indeed. In any case, aside from films, do you enjoy any sports?", " Not really a sports person, but my brother, and his wife loves football, so I end up chiming in from time to time. Amazing after all those foot ball players only 1 or 2 are known to be left handed, interesting. ", " engineers are starting to cover places from sports to modern science. They have been improving drastically in every field, not just in sports.", " I like american football the best! I didn't realize how many different sports were considered football.", " I don't know but I also know that the highest paid government employees in many states are college coaches so I think we are placing way too much emphasis on sports. ", " So true. I would love to see more emphasis on the arts. Can you imagine what would have been lost in the world of music if someone like say Micheal Jackson was pushed towards sports only instead of being allowed to sing?", " No I didn't. What did they win an emmy for?  Was it for the show sports center?", " Wow. He really defeated the stereotype about sports students just getting through on sports scholarships instead of grades!", " I haven't read anything about sports, but I am reading an interesting book right now. I just started The Martian. What about you?", " Yea, wrestling is a pretty cool sport with all the clinches, throws, and takedowns", " Back in those days, i bet the greeks embraced sport as essential to the full life. I think it is great to exert yourself physically and mentally.", " I guess its a great way, I haven't practiced the sport personally but I think its great. Do you know who Denis Cyplenkov is?", " A sports fan?", " no not really I don't like sports, I do watch football sometimes though, and I saw the superbowl, what aboutyou?", " The New England Patriots, the only other pro sports team that is as succesful right now is the Golden State Warriors", " Eagles!!! I won't hold it against you!! Yeah Auntie!! Wow, that innovation by ESPN was something - for me it was always there and I never really thought about it but it absolutely makes a lot of sense. That was a good call. For me another innovation that springs to mind is the Video Referee that we have now a days that allows instant playback of a game. I love living in the age of such great technology. I think that it makes sports so much the more interesting. What do you think? ", " I agree. my high school did the same because a lot of importance was placed on sports - I am not convinced that it was for development of the students as it was for bragging rights of the town/city. Can you imagine a game where one team scored 222-0! That must have been a spectacle to see. I have never seen Green-Ellis but I'm sure that he was a joy to watch. Kinda like how I feel about Aikman when he played", " Bowling, mini-golf, and skating are some sports I don't see the same interest in as when I was a kid.  Too much technology again I guess.  It's good the football teams still get out there and play to inspire kids by playing their hearts out and never fumbling footballs like Green-ellis.", " Yeah, I think that football for me is the king of sports. Even though Golf has its big money paydays - in my opinion it's no where close to be as exciting. I personally admire how great football teams functions almost like close family when on the grid iron. Funny thing I read the other day - did you know that the University of Iowa once painted the locker room for visiting teams in pink? PINK!!!!", " The sport is not as popular as it used to be, so maybe thats it, football has become really popular", " That sounds like most sports though! Did you know there are no rules against women players in the NFL?", " Really? I wonder why more don't try out. It seems like that would bring a lot of attention to the sport that would then bring in more money. ", " He's just so indifferent to the entire world. (I have never seen it but have seen clips on sports shows).", " I imagine so.  Golf is such a major sport that courses in the US take up more space than Rhode Island and Delaware put together", " I do like mini golf as well, watching the sport is a bit boring though", " He must like the sport a lot, golf courses consume a lot of water, ", " Hi! I am not much into golf but know the sport. The USA has more golf courses than the rest of the world combined!", " okay, My mom and dad is a physical director and sports coach. My brother is a basket ball player. I am not a player but i play volley ball and 400 meters runner", " So sports runs in your blood lol too bad the NFL season is at its end.", " Yes it is. Do you listen to the radio much. I am a huge sports fan, and I often times listen to the radio instead of tv broadcasts because of the great detail they provide. I am trying to send this message, but for some reason it won't let me send", " Soccer is an insanely popular sport around the world. In the past, NFL football wasn't nearly so popular. In the 1960's  bowlers made twice as much as top football stars", " It's astonishing. College has become a shrine to sports teams. Sometimes people even end up getting an education there. Or so I've heard. I should have majored in football studies.", " The power of the AP test! He must have been pretty smart to do grad work while playing sports. ", " I do its one of my favorite sports, what about you? do you like it?", " Pro sports are hard in Cleveland, regardles of the team, lol. Yeah, he was the best at Halo 3. I've played that game, it's not that easy.", " I like the idea that bowling is a sport.  The NFL draft is constructed to spread out talent and make sure no one team outspends any other.  ", " HI, how are you? Are you hankering for a chat? Do you like sports?", " I like the idea of sports. I really don't think they should be as highly valued in society and I think pro sports players get away with way too much. I was young and dumb isn't really a reason or excuse. I think that they need to be held accountable and properly reflect on their actions and words.", " Well I don't think that they should be held accountable because they are role models but also because treating people with respect should be expected period. Theres a lot of good things about sports too and it's really cool how it is cross cultural. it is super popular in japan. ", " Well its a violent sport anyway, I could see them as kickers. there arent any restrictions in the league rules. I would just like to see more representation besides thin and bronze cheer leaders. I think they get the short end of the stick...the saints cheerleaders are forbidden at even dining in the same place together!", " its neat to me how intertwined technology is with sports nowadays. watching and playing. using tracking chips to track speed and rotation and stuff is really cool. it's like a fitbit on steroids.", " More time for commercials. I guess the highlight reels would be enough for me. I prefer sports with more action.", " I dont really know the variants on the sport. i figure its all about violence and pain. except soccer. that is not about pain at all.", " Yeah I do like the sport, what about you?", " There is Canadian Football, Austrailian football and other regional football sports", " Thats interesting, is Rubgy like another version of the sport?", " QBs are the worst to listen to. All they do is talk in cliches... And then some moron sports talk hosts tries to disect what they said. They said nothing Sparky and the Bandit!", " Wow that is awesome... Many can and have used to sport to get ahead in life and prove that the dumb jock stereo is false... Like Alex Smith who was working on a Master's Degree.", " Interesting..... more interesting is how we started with the foot (football) and ending  up talking about the brain..... full contact sport that football is   ", " How's it going, do you follow football? It is a family of team sports involving kicking a ball to score points", " I do, its my favorite sport, do you like it or watch it?", " Do you follow the other sports more than football? The warriors have to be fun going to!", " Oh wow, that's a ridiculous score. I don't watch any college sports actually. Never heard of this Doc Bonner QB previously.", " Why can't we harken back to the days when bowlers made way more money than football players? That's a sport I'm semi-good at!", " Do you like sports?", " Good morning!  Yes, I am a sports fan, Baseball first but follow most of the majors and minors.  You?", " It usually depends on my Fantasy Team in any given year.  I don't have a favorite team or player per se, but I do enjoy the sport and players as a whole and love good, competitive games.", " Not sure where you are geographically, but the bad behavior by Philly sports fans is legendary.  They boo'd Santa Claus!  So, the fact that they have a court and jail in their stadium is not surprising at all!", " There is also a basketball team called Tall Blacks in New Zealand so a lot of interesting facts about sports and names.", " I dont know much either, just some cool facts and also that its a sport played between two teams with 5 players each", " Yea i'm a big fan of the sports stations. Do you listen to podcasts?", " I do, I also like the variations of the sport, Rugby, Gaelic football.", " Or maybe African Americans tend to prefer other sports, like basketball. The Pats drafted the first German citizen into the NFL...Sebastian Vollmer. Guess some Germans like football too.", " Yeah, I like this type of action. You know when it startd and you know when it stops, unlike other sports. ", " According to sportscasters, they think it will come down to the patriots defense. ", " It's one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America.  ", " Brady is probably going to be the best QB in NFL history. I think the sport is in decline. I'm a fan, but the younger generations don't watch it as much. ", " Interesting, Imagine what kind of technology they will be implementing over the next 30 years into the sport? It will be very exciting!", " I wonder if it makes a difference.  I know in some sports being left handed can be a advantage.  It's funny that Tom Brady couldn't make his high school at times.", " I sincerely don't understand a coach's role in professional sports league. How do they affect the team's ability to win?", " I do think they are making attempts at prioritizing safety.  For example, they have chips that monitor every movement of the players and ball to better understand the game.  Maybe those will yield better and safer ways of dealing with the violence inherent in the sport?", " Are you a big football fan? It's my favorite sport to watch.", " That is hilarious. I never understood why people try and cheat in pro sports. You know you are going to get caught. They check everything nowdays.", " Huh..I did not know that. It seems like the NFL has turned football from a simple sport to an entertainment field with all the acts performing and the cheerleaders. ", " It can be a difficult sport to follow, Kellen Moore is the only lefty left in the league, but I think he just left.", " Yes, I do. You mean the US sport, right? Yes. ", " Yes, fun to watch. Tough to play. I prefer other sports like basketball. ", " Yeah it's pretty cool!  I wonder if other sports uses them?", " I wouldn't like to see that either, woman should play in another league or division just like the rest of sports", " oh i didn't! how do tracking chips work? i tend to forget that the sport is old.", " I think he must like the sport because the average earning of an engineer is higher than that of an nfl and mlb player!!", " That was a sign of the times. lol  Sure isn't like that now.  Bowling, baseball, boxing, and horse racing were huge back then and now all those sports have declined big time.", " I do like the NFL yeah, what about you? do you like the scared sport of football?", " I love the NFL. What's the scared sport of football?", " Football, I meant football as in sacred sport at least it is to many myself included", " Could be, I think genders should be mixed though, just like in other sports there can be a womans NFL league ", " I have a passing knowledge of football and the NFL. I'm sure your know that the NFL is among the 4 major sports leagues in North America, but did you know that there is no written rule against female players?", " The science of sport is becomign really sophistocated with analytics and the amount and quality of measurement.", " Yes, football is one of my favorite sport, do you like the sport also?", " Yes you are right, It's good to have an education, but there are quite a few sport players and singers who didn't finish school. Education is a good back up.", " That is right, and on the other hand , another QB, wanted to trade sports to become a competitive videogame player, good he didn't do it", " hi how are you? do you like sports?", " I'm good. Yes I do like sports.", " what is your favorite sport? i like soccer a lot. it is also called football.", " I'm surprised that there's only one left-handed QB in the NFL. Thinking of all the QBs and all the lefties in other sports, that number seems low.", " Yes, absolutely for as much as they go through, all the skills they must have, let alone everything that comes with it such as injuries. you would think they would make more. You are right an engineer makes more than a football player. A soccer player makes more than all the other sports such as NFL and NBL combined.", " I wonder how much an esports player makes, as opposed to a quarterback? There's one that played for University of OK that was going to quit football to competitively game full time. That's kind of fun.", " The NFL is one of the major sports league in North America.", " The NFL formed in 1922, it was agree to merge with AFL in 1966.  The NFL has highest attendance compared to other sports.", " I wonder if it is true in the off-season too. Imagine being a cheerleader and panicking every time someone with a football jersey walks into your restaurant.  Oh, well, the gruelling 17-week season is over for another year. We will have to wait a while before the next season starts. Until then, we get to hear pundits recite sports trivia for a year.", " I think I would ask for a doggie bag if a player came in. That's not fair, though. I am glad the Superbowl is over for this year. I have to listen to my male friends reciting sports trivia, never mind seeing it on T.V.", " I have heard. does that matter though? i dont see women trying to get in. it is a pretty tough sport for anyone.", " He's 41.  How long can they keep it up.  Not an easy sport.", " Yes I am, it's my favorite sport to watch. Who is your favorite team?", " oh c'mon, gender equality in sports ;) no way, they are changing with the boys :) lol", " No.  That is news to me.  But it seems like good use of technology.  It is a multi-billion dollar sport so it is worth the investment.", " Probably loves the sport and has the talent.  Superbowl winning quarterback brad johnson is the only quarterback in the NFL history to throw a touchdown to himself.", " Perhaps if it's always been that way, it's why no one makes a big deal about so many men playing the sport. Because a woman could play if she's eligible", " I guess it was not that popular of a sport back in the day as it is now", " At least it's not a sport that's only played by a minority. Even the US Supreme Court enjoys shooting hoops for some fun. The \"highest court in the land\" is actually a basketball court on the top floor of their building", " Of course, if they get competitive, it would just be a different type of stress. I can't imagine how stressful it was for James Naismith who invented basketball. I'm not sure what sport he coached while at the University of Kansas, but he is the only losing coach in their history", " Yeah, football sure is America's favorite sport as some like to call it. In other countries, it's known as gridiron football, rugby, and they have different rules. I would like to see different takes on America's pasttime sport in other countries.", " Hi there! I am a big sports fan. I like basketball, football, and dance. What about you?", " Hello, are you particularly interested in sports?", " Hello, it depends on which sport. I'm a basketball fan, and am fascinated by the fact that there is a court in the Supreme Court Buliding.", " Oh for sure, I can't imagine being able to have that much access. I wonder if they have something similar for other sports, you a fan of football or baseball at all?", " Yeah it's certainly interesting how the same sports differ in different areas. Anyways it was nice talking to you, have a good day!", " It does. But what really confused me is how so many places consider different sports football. ", " Hey, I am really into watching sports. Football is my favorite though. A lot going on in sports right now thouhg.", " Football is my favorite as well although I also like watching all the major sports. Who are your favorite teams?", " Do you like any other sports?", " Hi. Do you watch sports?", " Yes especially if you are the inventor of the sport!", " He was the inventor of the sport! wow, seems like he forgot the rules of his own game lol", " Hi! Do you like fun trivia about sports?", " Do you like other sports? In 39 out of 50 states basketball or football coaches are the highest state paid employees ", " It is amazing how much money sports players get paid. Funny that in the 60s bowlers got paid more than football stars in Iowa", " Bowling was pretty big back then. Most al lsports contracts are crazy, but they are the best athletes.", " Yes. Well have a great day and keep enjoying sports", " I normally just listen to sports talk radio to get to sleep. ", " To get to sleep? What do you listen to? I listen to sports podcasts and have a few favs.", " I try to find local stuff. But when I go to bed, there isn't to much local sports talk on the radio. Thus, I listen to one of the ESPN podcasts that's on. Hate the female sportscasters though.", " I've listened to him for 12 years and it is getting too sportsy for me. And I do love sports! I would like more pop culture in there...", " They hit on it once in a while but not as much as I want. Pop culture may not be the right term... maybe stray away from sports because they are all fun and really smart. Would help the show.", " I also hate when they play sports clips that are inaudible...happens more now than back in my day. If you can't make out what's going on....why play it?", " I graduated from radio broadcasting. My teachers would have never put up with lousy audio sports clips on the radio.", " True. I think football is an amazing sport and Tom deserves all the notability that he is getting.", " No, I really don't follow soccer at all.  Are you a fan? The biggest sport I'm interested in is baseball, actually. ", " You bet. Hope you enjoy your fav sports!", " The sport takes its toll on the body and mind. No reason to keep going if you're not going to be able to enjoy the money.", " I enjoy playing football and have a passing knowledge of the sport", " I guess bowling was established and probably TV cameras could capture it well. Weekend leagues made it a sport that people knew. Football was really organized at the college level.", " I sure didnt know that, I think its an interesting fact though, I am more of a sports fan myself, do you like basketball?", " Not sure, I like the brand Nike and sport shoes, what about you?", " nope I personally don't. But I also don't really buy any sports clothes what about you? I guess they took a hit because of recent politics they were engaged in?", " That's something to be proud of. During the twentieth century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.", " I know, he will report in the spring for training and then leave. He cannot do both as a QB. I know too much sports...", " You like any sports? Football? My favorite team is the Saints", " I do, I love the Cowboys.  It is funny so many different sports are called football.  Soccer or Australian rules are called football too.", " I do, I love the sport, do you?", " I do like it, not when a team wins by 222 points but I think its a cool sport. ", " True, radio is so amazing how it uses radio waves to transport information.", " Yeah I totally agree, I hope it's close again.  I'm like that with most sports, even when I play them in rec leagues. ", " Yep.  Apparently he was complaining on a local sports talk radio show.  He believes the patriots don't have enough offensive weapons.", " There inlays the problem with sports; it is not one team one fight moreover it is a bunch of people trying to standout for the better on themselves and not the better of the team in question.", " Even as his brother plays in the same sport I feel he too is looking for the light to shine on him and him alone, not so much as on the entire team. if one player plays bad then the team as a whole must compensate. they should all be portrayed as equals no mater the position.", " What is your favorite sport? Mine is either Basketball or Football.", " I wonder why more players don't try that style? Since we're talking about sports, do you watch baseball? I've always wanted to see a player catch a ball with his hat but apparently the opposing team receives three bases if that happens. ", " I do watch some baseball. Baseball managers wear uniforms because they are allowed to play for their team. I believe that that is the only sport that allows that!", " I do if it is Az Cardinal's lol, not much time to follow any of the sports. ", " That is crazy... and one of the easiest sports if you ask me?", " Hi there!  Are you a fan of professional sports?", " Cars certainly have come a long way. I've heard predictions that in the next decade, driveless vehicles will take over large parts of the transportation industry. Not sure what the truck drivers will do for work.", " Very interesting. Do you play any fantasy sports?", " No, I do not think I have a deep enough understanding of any sport to create a team. I probably could write a fantasy novel though, but nowhere near as long as the 15,000 page manuscript created by a janitor in Chicago.", " Of course. At least there are three other major sports leagues in America. I can't imagine how it would be if they were all owned by the same people", " Hi there. Are you a football fan? Interesting that multiple sports coincide with the name.", " I like \"futbol\" best. Soccer has so much more action and talent in my opinion. though I'm impressed with the superimposed  graphics in all of the sports that have made it easier to watch", " it's crooked for sure. organized sports is a racket. they should take care of their players more too. the concussions that that suffer! the brain damage it causes later...", " That's a weird sport for them to choose. I would think basketball...", " Sure, what if we talk about the radio. Did you know that radio waves can be used to transport information", " Yeah, I read about that. The NBA has a lot of stupid rules, without the slam dunk the sport would be boring to watch. ", " That was probably the best endorsement in the history of all sports. ", " Wow. Do you know where the sport was invented?", " I wonder how much they make thoug? maybe basketball coaches just make a ton of money afterall its a sport that involves a lot of cash", " Funny to think that a semi dress piece of clothing was made for sport.  I guess people were more civilized back then.", " Yeah I would feel bad too. Bad sportsmanship. Isn't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960's!", " And Baker Mayfield is good at gaming as well as football. It's good to see that many of them are talented in more than just sports", " What sports do you enjoy?", " Football is an interesting sport. i dont know much about it.", " i expect that anything could be a fantasy sport or game. there is fantasy congress. people like competition and the chance to gamble.", " Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal", " That is sad. Do you ever watch football by the way? It's a team sport and can be pretty violent.", " Hi! Are you interested in sports, especially football?", " Right? Lol. Do you play any fantasy sports? There's actually a fantasy draft for the National Spelling Bee.", " what that is really weird, see I don't watch sports but I do follow politics so maybe I should get into that, people even fantasy draft the national spelling bee, people will fantasy draft anything I guess haha", " Not a fan. I am more a fan of sports. I love watching quarterbacks. I think that they are so gifted. Did you hear about Kellan Moore who is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl?", " Hi, do you play any fantasy sport games?", " Yeah I guess it makes things more fun and interesting. In addition to sports there is even a fantasy congress lol. ", " In your country, do people call the sport soccer or football?", " Hi, how are you? Do you follow sports at all?", " I don't follow sports that much. I did watch the Superbowl this year, what about you?", " Haha you're probably right. Do you ever watch sports on ESPN? Apparently they won an Emmy for inventing the yellow line that they use to show  the first down", " Yeah I do, a lot of sports programming, I don't think I saw the Kavanaugh program though. ", " I think you are like a lot of people in that sense. I watch a lot of sports programs myself. ", " That makes sense though. The Super Bowl is a big deal and is one of the most watched sporting events of the year", " That doesn't surprise me, it appears to be the most popular sport in the world, since it's played everywhere. Even Jon stewart used to be a soccer player!", " Oh wow, that's insane. who knew being left handed would make such a difference in a spot. Considering how dangerous the sport is, i'm surprised people still play it", " They do. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport.", " The ball is probably not going to be as big a problem because it does not have the mass for the momentum. Rugby could be another sport with concussion problems though.", " It is the world sport. People love soccer. It is a way of life. They play, they discuss, they cheer. Men and women.", " Would you be much of a sports fan?", " Not sure that sounds very interesting.  Do you listen to sports radio like The Team 980?", " They probably weren't listening to sports radio back then.  I've tried listening to dramas on the radio but I lose focus.", " Ah, yeah! It could be that whole sports/superstition thing! I never thought of it that way!", " I like both, I mostly watched TV for news and sports and when speeches are being made.", " Wow I didn't know the NFL was that old. I always thought it was the newest major sports league, but the NBA only started in 1946.", " Good Morning! Do you like to watch sports?", " Nah, I enjoy talking the sports thing once in a while, so I enjoyed chatting. Makes me seem like I actually know what I'm talking about, ha ha.", " Yeah, we waste so much time with transportation. It feels like just getting to work is one of the most stressful parts of working.", " yes, quite true. travel in general can be quite stressful. transportation is often not very comfortable.", " No, I take public transportation and it can be a little sketchy at times. A lot of drunk people in the subway late at night. Iceland has no public rail service.", " Yes. I like cars. Cars is a motor vehicle used for transportation in roads and carry people safely.", " Yes, speaking of cars, most definitions of a car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods. And, cars didn't became widely available until the early 20th century.", " Hi! Do you like sports? I really like football and to be honest, I didn't really enjoy the super bowl game, but I do like the quarterback, Tom Brady.", " I like some sports. I did watch the Super Bowl and it was crazy boring. I'm not a Brady fan but I respect his talent. Are you familiar with Alex Smith?", " Yeah, that is impressive, to my understanding, it seems like education comes second to sports for these great athletes, but not the case for Alex Smith and also for Baker Mayfield. He's also a great competitive gamer, claiming he can beat anyone in Halo.", " There is such a thing as lingerie bowl? Yeah, the physical requirements are pretty high, even when games average only 11 minutes of live game play, I think football is still a pretty aggressive sport.", " I really don't get into it.  I respect the sport.  I do know that the U.S. got 3rd place in the st FIFA World Cup in 1930.", " I really liked sliding sports in the winter games.    Do you know what any of them are called?", " Do you like watching sports?", " Hi! Are you a sports fan? Football or baseball?", " Do you think great broadcasters are important to sports games?", " I don't know. I guess I don't really care because I don't watch sports haha but I know that a lot of people do think that they are very important. And they can pick them out of a crowd which I can't haha what do you think?", " I don't really watch sports but I guess some people feel it's important. In an article I read they say that broadcasters have been more of loudmouths, kind of drowning out the actual sports.", " They are really cool. My husband says they are not comfortable, though. It's amazing how much money is spend on sports technology these days.", " No, he's not but he just liked the style, ha. I find it interesting that ESPN won an emmy for the superimposed line for football games. Americans really take their sports seriously!", " Lots of money in sports marketing. Iverson signed a lifetime endorsement deal with Reebok that would pay him $800,000 per year until he reached 55, and then he would get a lump sum of $32 mil. Another sale\u2026", " Character is worth the wait, and sports have changed a lot over the years.  Did you know that in the 1960, the top bowlers were paid more than the best NFL players? I don't ever remember seeing a $32 mil bowling shoe endorsement deal...", " How come there's an association with Japanese liking baseball? I prefer other sports like football and basketball. Though even from being in Texas, I have never heard of the high school stadium that costs $60 million to build and can seat 18K people! ", " I don't know.   Probably some live thing which might include other sports like Baseball.", " That is hilarious! But I don't follow the race car scene or sport. I agree, cars are so much safer these days, but it seems like it comes at a cost to the environment. How long do you typically wait before getting a new car? Or what is the criteria for when it's time to get a new car?", " Football is actually a family of team sports when you consider it world wide.", " Well, it is the biggest sport in many countries.  American football, baseball and basketball are all bigger here.  The world has not done much against the US in basketball.", " I am sure it does.  The most valuable sports franchise in the entire world is Manchester United, a soccer team in the UK. Nice Chatting.", " It is. Do you like football? There are so many different sports that they refer to as football", " Hi! Did you know football can also mean a lot of other things, in certain places, sports commonly called football in certain places include association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union)", " I watch it when it is on and I have a passing knowledge of the nfl, which is among the 4 major sports league in north America, but I don't follow it dedicatedly. How about you?", " I agree, its a tough sport. Given the players salaries i guess it evens out. Engineers are getting paid a lot more than i originally thought if they make more than NFL and MLB Players. ", " I think its fine, people change careers all the time,  im sure sports players can too. ", " It is one of the few sports I couldn't get into.  Id play for fun, in pick up games, but watching it is kind of dull.  Another sport with long game times and no action.", " Football is a tough sport and hard on the body. Baker mayfield probably should have pursued his love of competitive gaming instead of football.", " I think it is likely due to the fact that most Americans are less comfortable watching women play a heavy contact sport.", " Baseball is another great sport I do like it, not only its popular in the US but it has a lot of fans in Japan", " the GT coach should have put in the third string and maybe even the cheerleaders. or played a different sport entirely, like basketball.", " bowlers were lucky because the sport was very popular back in the day. now they are not so popular.", " Yeah I dont see bowlers making much money these days, there are many more popular sports now", " Yeah I guess with the sport's popularity that comes as no surprise", " Good Afternoon!  I listen to a lot of talk radio (sports/politics) while I'm at work - passes the time and keeps me informed.  You?", " I do for sports talk now.  It is very interesting to me that a radio station translates solar activity into sound and anyone can listen to the \"music of the sun.\"", " Times have really change for sports. In the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars. Does anyone watch bowling now? Maybe the U of Iowa would paint the other team's lanes pink or something.", " What is the most popular sport in the world?", " Football is my favorite sport.  Did you enjoy playing QB?  How many years did you play?", " Yeah, that would be a nightmare. I don't think they would allow that today for the sportsmanship of the game.", " I think its a great sport, I like it and find it really engaging, do you have like a favorite team?", " I have watched Rugby and think its a nice sport as well, I also like dancing, ", " Rugby is a sport for the strong.  Dancing is very helpful to all kinds of athletes.  Bruce Lee won the Honk Kong Cha-Cha championship in 1958. ", " Yes, it looks painful as well.  I wonder if a pro ballet dancer makes more than a top bowler?  Some sports stars make lots of money. in the 1960's bowlers made more than football stars.", " hi how are you doing today? do you like sports?", " I like sports, I like all forms of football, even Canadian football. ", " no, i think that maybe there is something about the sport that attracts righties to that position. i think some great lefties have played QB in the past though.", " It is special, I think it is the only sport that the manager can play for their team if they need it, that is why they wear a uniform. ", " Baseball is an old sport, they had baseball cards in the 1900s, they are worth millions now. ", " Love baseball.  That's my favorite sport.  Did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they technically are able to play for their teams if they are needed?", " It must be a hard job for just two people, anyway sports are great Im glad they exist! ", " I guess the family has been a sporting family, and not just in Football", " I bet they do that for mental intimidation, wow, I never knew that. I am not a big sports person. I guess many people love football. How about you?", " I never knew that either. I can not recall seeing a manager ever play before but it may have happened. There is a lot I do not know about sports and sports trivia. Do you have any baseball card? That man found 3million dollars of old cards, wow!!! ", " I enjoyed taking to you and learning some sport trivia and facts. ", " If you are defining radio as the actual use of FM and AM, then no, I never listen. I listen to a lot of podcasts and sportify. I also listen to XM.", " yes, i do. its the most democratic of sports. minimal equipment, men and women, young and old.", " Seems like.  Supposedly it spilled onto the field and got caught on camera.  That and the stern talking to from dad, NFL Saints QB Drew Brees.  Its not too often normal life spills into professional sporting events or live TV!", " Car is wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation, safety carrying the people which is have new technology to have rear camera, disc braking system.", " At work I listed to a lot of talk radio, sports and politics to pass the time.  At home I listen to a lot of music, but not on a traditional radio station.  I listen to podcasts while walking the dogs too!", " I'm not sure.

Do you know who invented the sport of basketball?", " Hi there. Are you a sports fan? ", " Not sure .. but they are associated with black uniforms in other sports too ", " Yes it was not that popular of a sport back in the day", " I'm a bit surprised that bowlers made so much money in the 60s. I guess more people knew the sports and there were sponsors or something.", " I like watching the NFL - football is the best of the 4 major professional sports.", " I do, its actually one of my favorite sports, do you like it?", " No, I watched sunday's game also, my current home is Las Vegas and I pretty much live in the casino watching sports, I try to watch the majority of the games including college football.", " Oh so do you have a favorite sport that you spend time watching on your days off from work or just for your relaxed and run time?", " It's amazing the amount of information they collect in sports now.  When I read reports about soccer they tell  you how far the player has ran, sprinted, pass percentages and such. They have heat maps to to show where they've been on the field too.", " That is really incredible. A lot of money flows through sports and keeps players engaged. Baker Mayfield almost became a professional gamer instead of QB. It was a good thing that he wised up for all our sakes. The money is in football.", " did you know football can mean different sports depending on what region you are in?", " Hi!  Are you a fan of sports?", " It seems like doing anything in sports will get you some notoriety, like ESPN winning an Emmy for the yellow line. Clearly I chose the wrong line of work", " Yup.  Highest court in the land :)  It is odd though, that the inventor of the sport went on to be the only losing coach at the U of Kansas.", " There definitely is a lot of money in sports, even if you arent like Green-Ellis and never have a fumble.", " I am. I'm a big fan of sports and sports trivia, in general.", " Great, sounds like we will get along, I am a fan of sports as well, do you have a favorite team?", " I watch the Super Bowl. I don't normally watch a lot of sports though. Do you like the Patriots? They have a player that has never fumbled the ball before. His name is Benjarvus Green-Ellis", " Yes I agree with you. Like I said I don't really watch sports so I'm not sure if he's a current player or not haha. What I do know is that ESPN won an Emmy. They created that yellow line that shows the first downs on football games", " I do, I love the sport, so the NFL has 2 divisions NFC and AFC", " Yeah I guess it was a more popular sport back in the day", " I recently read that they are the only community owned major franchise in american professional sports, having a sold out game since 1960 and involving the community as a whole.", " I like it! I like all sports really. I think which type of football you like depends on the area you live in. I like them all.", " Yes and beat by fairies..appropriate ;) .  Some things about this sport are interesting.  I couldn't imagine having gone to the Georgia Tech game.  A 222-0 score??  Did the other team even show up?", " Not a fan of Rodgers but the green bay packers are the only community owned, not for profit major franchise in american professional sports", " Yes, they are tough at home no doubt.  Dallas plays at home though.  The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America,", " Yep you're right about that. I don't know how popular will be so I don't know how much money they'll make but it is interesting that the salaries of the sports have changed over time like you mentioned", " wow impressive. There used to be octopus wrestling matches as a sport", " I guess it was a much more popular sport back in the day", " I've got a friend who was a wrestler (not professional but still) and he always preferred the term \"scripted\".  Tell him it was fake and he's liable to body slam ya and say, \"Did that feel fake, to you?\":  LOL.  My brother used to wrestle in high school, course he was the sports guy in our family so he did about every sport imaginable.  ", " Yeah, it's amazing how detailed they can get with the graphics on football games nowadays.  I remember back when it was just one guy (usually Madden) and he had to \"draw in\" the white line pointing to everything. (\"And you got the guy going here...\")  hehe.  So, did you play any sports when you were younger?", " Yeah, isn't that a trip?  Pink has a psychological effect on people.  They say they did a study where the turned a weight room pink and found the lifters suddenly couldn't lift as much as they normally could.  Me, like I said, I was never much a sports player, but my brother got a football scholarship to college.", " I never ever heard that about him.  He was pretty tall though so he probably had some good leverage.  The Turkish national sport is oil wrestling where men douse themselves in olive oil and wrestle.  That's kind of different...and odd at the same time.  lol", " Well since the found was Vince McMahon, it really is not a surprise he would try to start something like XFl. guess he wanted to try his hand at other sports.", " Not familiar with wrestling at all.  Although I have read 1 thing I always thought.  The sport can either be \"theatrical\" or competitive.", " It's a tough sport for sure.  Guess there are risks in all sports though.  Except maybe swimming.  As long as you're not with piranhas.", " Yeah, lets get as much involved as possible, it's like fusion cooking but for sports.  Unlike the NFL we could a written rule saying women have to play.", " It is crazy how dominant they have been.  15 AFC East titles in 17 years in a sport with that much free agency is just unfathomable!", " 15 out of 17 no kidding!! that is amazing I dont think that will happen again in the history of the sport", " I sometimes watch. It's an interesting sport.", " I think at the highest level of sports that athletes are so tuned in that the only thing that might throw them off is their own mistake or the refs.", " Yeah. It seems like he used his sports platform to talk about the difficulties of being gay and the difficulties that a lot of younger people face.", " Well thank you. Do you enjoy any sports?", " I enjoy all sports. What about you?"]
